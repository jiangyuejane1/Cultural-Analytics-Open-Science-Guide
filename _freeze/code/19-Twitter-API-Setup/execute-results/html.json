    "markdown": "# Twitter API Setup\n\nTo collect Twitter data, we're going to work with the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started) and [twarc2](https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/twarc2/), a Python package for collecting Twitter data through the Twitter API.\n\nTo use the Twitter API and twarc, we first need to complete the following steps:\n\n1. Apply for a Twitter developer account, which also requires making or already having a regular Twitter account\n\n2. Get Twitter API keys\n\n3. Install twarc\n\n4. Configure/set up twarc\n\nThe following instructions will help guide you through this process.\n\n## Apply for a Twitter Developer Account\n\nIf you are an academic researcher (e.g., \"post-doc, professor, fellow, master's student working on a thesis, PhD candidate, or affiliated with an academic institution AND have a clearly defined project\"), you can apply for [the Academic Research track]( https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/academic/is-it-right-for-you) of the Twitter API, which enables access to all Twitter data.\n\nIf you are an undergraduate student or not affiliated with an academic institution, you can apply for [a standard developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access), which enables access to tweets from the last week as well as tweets in real time. \n\n## Get API Keys and Bearer Token\n\nOnce you've applied for a developer account and had it approved by Twitter, you need to generate your API keys and bearer token — the special passwords that will allow you to work with the Twitter API. To generate your API keys and bearer token, you can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/twitterdev/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api-v2-for-academic-research/blob/main/modules/4-getting-your-keys-and-token.md) from Suhem Parack, the Developer Advocate for Academic Research at Twitter.\n\nAfter you generate your API keys and bearer token, you should record them in a secure location on your computer (do not share them on the internet because these are private like passwords!).\n\n## Install twarc2\n\nTo install twarc2, you can run the following from command line:\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:10:29.526532Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:10:26.607342Z\"}' tags='[\"command_line\"]' execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n!pip install twarc --upgrade\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRequirement already satisfied: twarc in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (2.12.0)\r\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.8 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from twarc) (2.8.2)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: humanize>=3.9 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from twarc) (3.13.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: click<9,>=7 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from twarc) (8.1.3)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: tqdm>=4.62 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from twarc) (4.64.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: requests-oauthlib>=1.3 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from twarc) (1.3.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: click-config-file>=0.6 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from twarc) (0.6.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: click-plugins>=1 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from twarc) (1.1.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: configobj>=5.0.6 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from click-config-file>=0.6->twarc) (5.0.6)\r\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.8->twarc) (1.16.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: requests>=2.0.0 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests-oauthlib>=1.3->twarc) (2.28.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: oauthlib>=3.0.0 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests-oauthlib>=1.3->twarc) (3.2.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests>=2.0.0->requests-oauthlib>=1.3->twarc) (3.3)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: urllib3<1.27,>=1.21.1 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests>=2.0.0->requests-oauthlib>=1.3->twarc) (1.26.11)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests>=2.0.0->requests-oauthlib>=1.3->twarc) (2022.9.24)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<3,>=2 in /Users/paschalis/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests>=2.0.0->requests-oauthlib>=1.3->twarc) (2.0.12)\r\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Configure/Set up Twarc\n\nOnce twarc is installed, you need to configure it with your API keys and/or bearer token so that you can actually access the API.\n\nTo configure twarc, you can run the following from the command line:\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:10:58.887360Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:10:58.882263Z\"}' tags='[\"command_line\"]' execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# !twarc2 configure\n```\n:::\n\n\nTwarc will ask for your bearer token, which you can copy and paste into the blank after the colon, and then press enter. You can optionally enter your API keys, as well.\n\nIf you've entered your information correctly, you should get a congratulatory message that looks something like this:\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:11:05.436201Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:11:05.433039Z\"}' tags='[\"command_line\"]' execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Your keys have been written to /Users/melwalsh/Library/Application Support/twarc/config\n\n\n# ✨ ✨ ✨  Happy twarcing! ✨ ✨ ✨\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow you're ready to collect and analyze tweets!\n\n",

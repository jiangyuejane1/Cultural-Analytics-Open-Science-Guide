Many APIs require authentication keys to gain access to them. To get your necessary Genius API keys, you need to navigate to the following URL: [https://genius.com/api-clients](https://genius.com/api-clients).\n\n<img src=\"../images/Genius-API.png\" width=100% >\n\nYou'll be prompted to sign up for [a Genius account](https://genius.com/signup_or_login), which is required to gain API access. Signing up for a Genius account is free and easy. You just need a Genius nickname (which must be one word), an email address, and a password.\n\nOnce you're signed in, you should be taken to [https://genius.com/api-clients](https://genius.com/api-clients), where you need to click the button that says \"New API Client.\"\n\n<img src=\"../images/Genius-New-API.png\" width=100% >\n\nAfter clicking \"New API Client,\" you'll be prompted to fill out a short form about the \"App\" that you need the Genius API for. You only need to fill out \"App Name\" and \"App Website URL.\"\n\nIt doesn't really matter what you type in. You can simply put \"Song Lyrics Project\" for the \"App Name\" and the URL for our course website \"https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/\" for the \"App Website URL.\"\n\nWhen you click \"Save,\" you'll be given a series of API Keys: a \"Client ID\" and a \"Client Secret.\" To generate your \"Client Access Token,\" which is the API key that we'll be using in this notebook, you need to click \"Generate Access Token\".\n\nFinally, copy and paste your \"Client Access Token\" into the quotation marks below, and run the cell to save your variable \n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:37.246546Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:37.240242Z\"}' execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# client_access_token = \"INSERT YOUR CLIENT ACCESS TOKEN IN THESE QUOTATION MARKS\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Protecting Your API Key\n\nFor this lesson, if you just copy and paste your Genius API key into your Jupyter notebook, everything should be fine. But that's actually not the best way of storing your API keys. If you published this notebook to GitHub, for example, other people might be able to read and use/steal your API key.\n\nFor this reason, it's best practice to keep your API keys away from your code, such as in another file. For example, I made a new Python file called \"api_key.py\" that contains just one variable `your_client_access_token = \"MY API KEY\"`, and I can import this variable into my notebook with `import api_key`. \n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:06:55.739050Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:06:55.710960Z\"}' execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# import api_key\n```\n:::\n\n\nBy importing this Python file/module, I get access to the variable `your_client_access_token` without ever explicitly typing my secret API token in this notebook. If I wanted to publish this notebook to GitHub, then I could ignore or leave out the \"api_key.py\" file that actually contains my Client Access Token.\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:38.243929Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:38.243917Z\"}' execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# api_key.your_client_access_token\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<div class=\"admonition attention\" name=\"html-admonition\" style=\"background: lightyellow; padding: 10px\">\n\n<p class=\"title\">Attention</p>\n\nYou should only un-comment and run the cell below if you are importing your API key from the Python file \"api_key.py\". If you have already set your `client_acces_token` in this notebook, you can skip the cell below.\n\n</div>\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:38.436046Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:38.432233Z\"}' execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# client_access_token = api_key.your_client_access_token\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Making an API Request\n\nMaking an API request looks a lot like typing a specially-formatted URL. But instead of getting a rendered HTML web page in return, you get some data in return.\n\nThere are a few different ways that we can query the Genius API, all of which are discussed in the [Genius API documentation](https://docs.genius.com/#songs-h2). The way we're going to cover in this lesson is [the basic search](https://docs.genius.com/#search-h2), which allows you to get a bunch of Genius data about any artist or songs that you search for:\n\n`http://api.genius.com/search?q={search_term}&access_token={client_access_token}`\n\nSticking with our Missy Elliott theme/obsession, we're going to search for Genius data about Missy Elliott.\n\nFirst we're going to assign the string \"Missy Elliott\" to the variable `search_term`. Then we're going to make an f-string URL that contains the variables `search_term` and `client_access_token`.\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:39.549410Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:39.544786Z\"}' execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# search_term = \"Missy Elliott\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:39.719825Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:39.715074Z\"}' execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# genius_search_url = f\"http://api.genius.com/search?q={search_term}&access_token={client_access_token}\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis URL is basically all we need to make a Genius API request. Want proof? Run the cell below and print this URL, then copy and paste it into a new tab in your web browser.\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:40.085510Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:03:40.078256Z\"}' execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# print(genius_search_url)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt doesn't look pretty, but that's a bunch of Genius data about Missy Elliott!\n\nWe can programmatically do the same thing by again using the Python library `requests` with this URL. Instead of getting the `.text` of the response, as we did before, we're going to use `.json()`.\n\n[JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) is a data format that is commonly used by APIs. JSON data can be nested and contains key/value pairs, much like a Python dictionary.\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:07:26.131943Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:07:26.128295Z\"}' execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport requests\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:07:26.696226Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:07:26.397038Z\"}' execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# response = requests.get(genius_search_url)\n# json_data = response.json()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe JSON data that we get from our Missy Elliott API query looks something like this:\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T12:05:43.565819Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T12:05:43.559692Z\"}' tags='[\"output_scroll\"]' execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# json_data\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can index this data (again, like a Python dictionary) and look at the first \"hit\" about Missy Elliott from Genius.com.\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:04:11.214155Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:04:11.182962Z\"}' execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# json_data['response']['hits'][0]\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can tell that this data describes the song \"Work It\" and contains other information about the song, such as its number of Genius annotations, its number of web page views, and links to images of its album cover.\n\n## Looping Through JSON Data\n\n### Get Song Titles\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:07:37.273433Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T11:07:37.240298Z\"}' execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# for song in json_data['response']['hits']:\n#     print(song['result']['full_title'])\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Get Song Tiles and Page View Counts\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T12:05:48.585684Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T12:05:48.582403Z\"}' execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# for song in json_data['response']['hits']:\n#     print(song['result']['full_title'], song['result']['stats']['pageviews'])\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Transform Song Titles and Page View Counts into a DataFrame\n\nWe can loop through this data, append it into a list, and then transform that list into a Pandas dataframe by calling `pd.DataFrame()`\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T12:05:50.224890Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T12:05:49.776065Z\"}' execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n:::\n\n\n<div class=\"admonition pandasreview\" name=\"html-admonition\" style=\"background: black; color: white; padding: 10px\">\n<p class=\"title\">Pandas</p>\n Do you need a refresher or introduction to the Python data analysis library Pandas?

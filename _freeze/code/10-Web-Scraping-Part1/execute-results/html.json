This is a corpus created by Cornell CIS professors Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee for their paper [\"Chameleons in imagined conversations\"](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/papers/chameleons.pdf). Go Big Red!\n\nThese researchers helpfully shared a dataset of every URL that they used to find and access the screenplays in their own project.\n\n**Import Pandas**\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:43.164906Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:42.702588Z\"}' execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Read in CSV file**\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:43.178660Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:43.167587Z\"}' execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurls = pd.read_csv(\"../data/cornell-movie-corpus/raw_script_urls.csv\", delimiter='\\t', encoding='utf=8')\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Display DataFrame**\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:43.195411Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:43.180088Z\"}' tags='[\"output_scroll\"]' execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurls\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>movie_title</th>\n      <th>script_url</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>m0</td>\n      <td>10 things i hate about you</td>\n      <td>http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/10Things.html</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>m1</td>\n      <td>1492: conquest of paradise</td>\n      <td>http://www.hundland.org/scripts/1492-Conquest...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>m2</td>\n      <td>15 minutes</td>\n      <td>http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/15minutes....</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>m3</td>\n      <td>2001: a space odyssey</td>\n      <td>http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/2001.txt</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>m4</td>\n      <td>48 hrs.</td>\n      <td>http://www.awesomefilm.com/script/48hours.txt</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>612</th>\n      <td>m612</td>\n      <td>watchmen</td>\n      <td>http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/wtchmn.txt</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>613</th>\n      <td>m613</td>\n      <td>xxx</td>\n      <td>http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/xXx.txt</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>614</th>\n      <td>m614</td>\n      <td>x-men</td>\n      <td>http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/xmenthing...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>615</th>\n      <td>m615</td>\n      <td>young frankenstein</td>\n      <td>http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/young.txt</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>616</th>\n      <td>m616</td>\n      <td>zulu dawn</td>\n      <td>http://www.aellea.com/script/zuludawn.txt</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>617 rows × 3 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEach movie title in this CSV file is paired with a URL for the screenplay. How can we actually use these URLs to get computationally tractable text data?\n\nThough we could manually navigate to each URL and copy/paste each screenplay into a file, that would be suuuuper slow and painstaking, and we would lose crucial data in the process — information that might help us automatically distinguish the title of the movie from the screenplay itself, for example. It would be much better to programmatically access the text data attached to every URL.\n\n## Responses and Requests\n\nTo programmatically access the text data attached to every URL, we can use a Python library called [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n\nWhen you type in a URL in your search address bar, you're sending an HTTP **request** for a web page, and the server which stores that web page will accordingly send back a **response**, some web page data that your browser will render.\n\n<img src=\"../images/request-response.png\" class=\"center\">\n\n### Import Requests \n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:43.286124Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:43.197955Z\"}' execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport requests\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Get HTML Data\n\nWith the `.get()` method, we can request to \"get\" web page data for a specific URL, which we will store in a varaible called `response`.\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:46.065451Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:43.287432Z\"}' execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nresponse = requests.get(\"http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/Ghostbusters.txt\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### HTTP Status Code\n\nIf we check out `response`, it will simply tell us its [HTTP response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), aka whether the request was successful or not.\n\n\"200\" is a successful response, while \"404\" is a common \"Page Not Found\" error.\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:46.079520Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:46.072005Z\"}' execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nresponse\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```\n<Response [200]>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's see what happens if we change the title of the movie from *Ghostbusters* to *Ghostboogers* in the URL...\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:46.329750Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:46.083515Z\"}' execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbad_response = requests.get(\"http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/Ghostboogers.txt\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:46.340102Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:56:46.334515Z\"}' execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbad_response\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=8}\n```\n<Response [404]>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<img src=\"../images/Ghostboogers.png\" class=\"center\" >\n\n### Extract Text From Web Page\n\nTo actually get at the text data in the reponse, we need to use `.text`, which we will save in a variable called `html_string`.

NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY\r\n\r\nThe sun shines brightly on the classic facade of the main library at Fifth\r\nAvenue and 42nd Street.  In the adjacent park area, pretty hustlers and\r\ndrug peddlers go about their business.\r\n\r\nFRONT STEPS\r\n\r\nA few people lounge on the steps flanked by the familiar stone lions.\r\n\r\nINT. MAIN READING ROOM -- DAY\r\n\r\nPeople are dotted throughout the room sitting at the long oak tables\r\npolished by decades of use.  Reading lamps with green glass shades cast a\r\ngolden glow on the tables.  The patina of age is everywhere.  It is very\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nLIBRARIAN\r\n\r\nA slightly stout, studious looking girl in her late twenties circulates\r\nquietly among the tables picking up books and putting them on her cart.\r\nEverything seems completely normal and peaceful.\r\n\r\nPOV\r\n\r\nA single eerie musical note signals the presence of something strange\r\nlooking down on the Librarian from a vantage point high above the room.\r\nIt follows the Librarian as she pushes her cart around the corner.\r\n\r\nINT. WORK AREA\r\n\r\nThe Librarian is alone in a back room sorting books for reshelving.\r\nBehind her is the card catalogue.  One of the books attracts her interest\r\nand she starts leafing through it.\r\n\r\nTHE CARD CATALOGUE\r\n\r\nAnother eerie note is heard as one of the drawers silently slides open\r\nbehind the Librarian and hundreds of index cards start popping out.  The\r\nLibrarian continues reading completely oblivious to this strange\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nShe gets up and moves past another row of cabinets.  Two more drawers\r\nquietly slide open, and thousands of file cards start shooting out of the\r\nopen drawers just behind her, but the Librarian still doesn't notice.\r\n\r\nTHE STACKS\r\n\r\nThe Librarian works her way through rows and rows of old iron shelves\r\ncontaining many thousands of volumes stacked from floor to ceiling.  As\r\nshe puts the books back in their proper places, she slowly gets the\r\nfeeling that she's being watched.  She continues her task but suddenly\r\nhears a scratching noise and stops.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLIBRARIAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(puzzled)\r\n\t\t\tHello?  Is anybody there?\r\n\r\nA ROW OF BOOKS\r\n\r\nAs the Librarian walks down the aisle, books start shooting off the shelf\r\nbehind her.  She turns suddenly and sees the fallen books.\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARIAN\r\n\r\nFrightened now, she walks slowly to the end of the aisle and tentatively\r\npeeks around the corner.  Seeing no one, she starts to scratch her head\r\nand suddenly a dozen books fly off the shelf right in front of her and\r\nfall to the floor.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLIBRARIAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(frightened)\r\n\t\t\tAll right!  Who's there?  Lyle? Is that you?\r\n\r\nVery slowly now, her heart pounding, the Librarian tiptoes to the other\r\nend of the aisle.  She gets to the corner and starts to peek around it,\r\nafraid to look but unable to resist.\r\n\r\nINT. THE NEXT AISLE -- DAY\r\n\r\nThe Librarian comes slowly around the end of the stacks and gets her first\r\nlook at the thing that's been watching her.  Her eyes go very wide and her\r\nmouth opens in horror. She screams.\r\n\r\nEXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY -- DAY\r\n\r\nStudents are entering and leaving a neo-Gothic building on the\r\nUniversity's upper west side campus.  A sign identifies the building as:\r\nWeaver Hall -- Department of Psychology.\r\n\r\nINT. BASEMENT -- WEAVER HALL -- DAY\r\n\r\nAt one end of the dingy corridor is a door marked PARANORMAL STUDIES\r\nLABORATORY.  A sign dangles from the doorknob: Maid -- Please Make Up This\r\nRoom.  Scrawled across the door is a line of student graffiti that reads:\r\n\"Venkman Burn In Hell!\"  It looks like it's been written in blood.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN (V.O.)\r\n\t\t\tNow I'm going to turn over the next card and\r\n\t\t\tI want you to concentrate and tell me what\r\n\t\t\tyou think it is.\r\n\r\nINT. PARANORMAL STUDIES LAB -- SAME TIME - DAY\r\n\r\nDR. PETER VENKMAN is administering an ESP test to two student volunteers,\r\na boy and a girl, who sit across the table from him separated from each\r\nother by a screen.\r\n\r\nVenkman is an associate professor but his rumpled suit and the manic gleam\r\nin his eyes indicate an underlying instability in his nature.  However,\r\nwhile a little short on academic credentials, Venkman is long on\r\nconfidence, charm and salesmanship.\r\n\r\nHe turns to the male volunteer, an obnoxious SOPHOMORE, and pulls out a\r\ncard from the standard deck of ESP symbols.  The card is visible to the\r\ncamera over Venkman's shoulder but hidden from the sophomore by a masonite\r\nboard that rests between them on the table.  The card shows a star symbol\r\non it.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tAll right.  What is it?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSOPHOMORE\r\n\t\t\t\t(concentrates)\r\n\t\t\tA square?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(shakes his head)\r\n\t\t\tGood guess -- but no.\r\n\r\nHe shows the Sophomore the star card then presses a button on the table\r\nwhich administers a mild electric shock to the volunteer.  The Sophomore\r\ntwitches involuntarily as the shock passes through the electrode attached\r\nto his fingertips.  Then Venkman turns to the female volunteer, a very\r\nbeautiful COED.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tNow just clear your mind and tell me what\r\n\t\t\tyou see.\r\n\r\nHe turns over a card with a circle on it.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCOED\r\n\t\t\t\t(thinks hard)\r\n\t\t\tIs it a star?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(feigning surprise)\r\n\t\t\tIt is a star!  That's great.  You're very\r\n\t\t\tgood.\r\n\r\nThe Coed beams proudly as Venkman turns back to the Sophomore without\r\nshowing her the card.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(to the Sophomore)\r\n\t\t\tNow think.\r\n\r\nHe turns up the diamond card.\r\n\r\nThe Sophomore glances nervously at the electrodes, then ventures a guess.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSOPHOMORE\r\n\t\t\tCircle?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tClose -- but definitely wrong.\r\n\r\nHe shocks him again and swivels around to face the Coed.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN (CONT'D)\r\n\t\t\tReady?\r\n\t\t\t\t(she nods and he turns up\r\n\t\t\t\tthe triangle card)\r\n\t\t\tWhat is it?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCOED\r\n\t\t\t\t(biting her lip)\r\n\t\t\tUmmm -- figure eight?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(lies)\r\n\t\t\tIncredible!  Five for five.  You're not\r\n\t\t\tcheating on me here, are you?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCOED\r\n\t\t\t\t(amazed at her own ability)\r\n\t\t\tNo.  They're just coming to me.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tWell, you're doing great.  Keep it up.\r\n\r\nHe turns back to the Sophomore who winces as the next card is turned\r\nup -- two parallel wavy lines.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN (CONT'D)\r\n\t\t\tNervous?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSOPHOMORE\r\n\t\t\tYes.  I don't like this.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tWell, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSOPHOMORE\r\n\t\t\t\t(takes a deep breath)\r\n\t\t\tTwo wavy lines?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(burying the card)\r\n\t\t\tSorry.  This isn't your day.\r\n\r\nHe zaps him again but this time the Sophomore really jumps.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSOPHOMORE\r\n\t\t\t\t(angry)\r\n\t\t\tHey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tYou volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we\r\n\t\t\tpaying you for this?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSOPHOMORE\r\n\t\t\tYeah, but I didn't know you were going to\r\n\t\t\tgive me electric shocks.  What are you\r\n\t\t\ttrying to prove?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tI'm studying the effect of negative\r\n\t\t\treinforcement on ESP ability.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSOPHOMORE\r\n\t\t\tI'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tThen my theory was correct.\r\n\r\nThe Sophomore gets up, pulls the electrodes off his fingertips and exits.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSOPHOMORE\r\n\t\t\t\t(as he goes)\r\n\t\t\tKeep the five bucks.  I've had it!\r\n\r\nVenkman turns back to the Coed and shrugs.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tWell, I guess some people have it and some\r\n\t\t\tdon't.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCOED\r\n\t\t\t\t(provocatively)\r\n\t\t\tDo you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tDefinitely.  I think you may be a very\r\n\t\t\tgifted telepath.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door opens and RAY STANTZ enters.\r\n\r\nSTANTZ\r\n\r\nHe is Venkman's colleague and best friend.  A hard scientist with a good\r\nacademic background, Stantz is a maverick who genuinely loves a challenge.\r\nAt the moment, he seems really keyed up.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tDrop everything, Venkman.  We got one.\r\n\r\nHe starts rummaging through cabinets and drawers, gathering up a variety\r\nof electronic devices.\r\n\r\nVENKMAN\r\n\r\nHe frowns at the intrusion and turns to the Coed.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tExcuse me for a minute.\r\n\t\t\t\t(he crosses to Stantz)\r\n\t\t\tRay, I'm right in the middle of something\r\n\t\t\there.

It blew books from shelves at\r\n\t\t\ttwenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some\r\n\t\t\tpoor librarian.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(unimpressed)\r\n\t\t\tSure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you\r\n\t\t\tshould get down there right away and check\r\n\t\t\tit out.  Let me know what happens.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\t\t(insistent)\r\n\t\t\tNo, this one's for real, Peter.

MAIN READING ROOM -- DAY\r\n\r\nEGON SPENGLER is looking for spirits when Venkman and Stantz arrive.\r\nSpengler is a real egghead, a New Wave Mr. Spock, who single-handedly got\r\nVenkman through graduate school.  Spengler is incredibly intelligent but\r\namazingly dense at the same time.  At the moment he is listening to a\r\ntable using a stethoscope connected to stereo earphones.  Venkman comes up\r\nbehind him and taps on the table to get his attention.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tEgon?\r\n\r\nSpengler hears the tapping and thinks he's made contact with the spirit\r\nworld.

Then a strange new sound attracts her attention and she\r\nturns around to see where it's coming from.\r\n\r\nDana hears the sound of muffled chanting coming from the fridge.  She\r\npulls the door open and gets the shock of her life.  The inside of the\r\nfridge has been transformed into the Gateway to another Realm -- a fiery\r\npath leading to a temple door.  On each side of the door is a strange,\r\nsnarling creature that could best be described as a TERROR DOG.  Their\r\nfront claws are raised toward each other in a symbolic pose.

Holding the\r\ndoor open with one foot, he reaches for the paper but can't quite stretch\r\nfar enough.

ROOM 1210 -- NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe room is dark but we can hear the sighs and heavy breathing of a man\r\nand woman making love on the bed.  The camera PANS across the floor\r\nfollowing a trail of dropped clothing -- a  tuxedo jacket and cummerbund,\r\nwhite satin high heels, a lacy wedding gown, striped tuxedo trousers,\r\nsatin ladies underpants, stockings and garters.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBRIDE (V.O.)\r\n\t\t\tAren't you glad we waited?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGROOM (V.O.)\r\n\t\t\tI don't know.

The vehicle  has been\r\npainted flat black and has been fitted with communication wafers and\r\nantennae.  All the original lights have been replaced with purple and\r\nwhite strobes and the siren has been altered to emit a low, unearthly\r\nmoaning  The purple and white strobe bars give the car a strange\r\nultraviolet aura.  It rounds the corner and heads up the West Side\r\nHighway.\r\n\r\nEXT. HOTEL -- FRONT DOOR -- NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe black ambulance screeches up to the main entrance, siren blaring.\r\nEmblazoned on the door is the Ghostbusters' new logo.

They open up the rear door and remove their\r\nequipment.  People on the street stop and gawk.\r\n\r\nINT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT\r\n\r\nAs the Ghostbusters enter, people turn and stare at their strange\r\nappearance.  They all wear matching blue futuristic jumpsuits with proton\r\npacks strapped to their backs.  They also wear brushed-metal, flip-down\r\necto-visors worn on the head like a welder's mask.  Knee and elbow pads\r\ncomplete their strange outfits.\r\n\r\nVENKMAN\r\n\r\nHe looks ill-at-ease and embarrassed by their outlandish getups as the\r\nHOTEL MANAGER descends on them accompanied by a Slavic MAINTENANCE MAN and\r\na worried BELL CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMANAGER\r\n\t\t\t\t(agitated)\r\n\t\t\tThank you for coming so quickly.

The wine is visible as it pours down his gullet and passes\r\nthrough his system, finally spilling through his body onto the floor.\r\n\r\nSTANTZ\r\n\r\nHe edges closer.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\t\t(whispers into his head\r\n\t\t\t\tset)\r\n\t\t\tI'm moving in.

I'm going to take him.\r\n\t\t\t\t(shouts at the vapor)\r\n\t\t\tFreeze, Potato-Face!\r\n\r\nHe fires his particle thrower at the vapor.\r\n\r\nTHE VAPOR\r\n\r\nIt dodges Stantz' first shot and the ion stream tears away fifty feet of\r\nwallpaper in a searing ricochet.  Then the vapor flies off down the hall,\r\npulling the room service cart along in its wake.\r\n\r\nSTANTZ\r\n\r\nHe chases it down the hall, shouting into his headset.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tHe's getting away!\r\n\r\nTHE VAPOR\r\n\r\nIt reaches the end of the corridor but instead of turning, it passes right\r\nthrough the solid wall.  The room service cart crashes into the wall,\r\nsmashing dishes and sending the debris flying.\r\n\r\nINT. A HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\nA MAN is just pulling the plastic bag off his recently dry-cleaned white\r\ndinner jacket when the noxious vapor comes shooting through the wall.  It\r\nblows right over him with a great rush of stinking wind and exits through\r\nthe air vent.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN\r\n\r\nHe looks at the air vent then back at his dinner jacket which has turned\r\nseveral shades of sickly yellow and brown.\r\n\r\nINT. A CORRIDOR -- NIGHT\r\n\r\nVenkman is alone in a long hallway.  He leans against the wall, clearly\r\nnot taking any of this seriously.  He hauls on a cigarette and mutters to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tThis bites it.  I actually work for a\r\n\t\t\tcompany called Ghostbusters.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from the end of the hallway comes the sound of rattling dishes\r\nand silverware, accompanied by footsteps.

Then immediately behind it comes a reeking yellow haze.  It is\r\nthe vapor.  It doesn't follow the cart but instead makes the turn at the\r\nend of the hall and hovers there, apparently looking at Venkman.\r\n\r\nVENKMAN\r\n\r\nHe's scared now.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(into his head set)\r\n\t\t\tIt's here, Ray.

STAIRWELL -- SAME TIME\r\n\r\nStantz runs downstairs taking them three at a time as Venkman is heard\r\nscreaming over the radio.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(screaming)\r\n\t\t\tVeeaaaaaahh!\r\n\r\nINT. THIRD FLOOR\r\n\r\nStantz comes running around the corner and sees Venkman flat on his back,\r\nflailing his arms and legs frantically,  Sickening, yellow-green ectofluid\r\ncovers his head and chest.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tAagghh -- aaaggghh -- uhh -- uhh -- It slimed\r\n\t\t\tme!

It just went into the\r\n\t\t\tBanquet Room on the third floor.\r\n\r\nStantz helps Venkman to his feet and they rush off.\r\n\r\nINT. BANQUET ROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe Ghostbusters enter a large dark room with a high, ornately-corniced\r\nceiling and a crystal chandelier hanging in the center.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tVisors down.  Full stream.\r\n\r\nThey flip down their visors and scan the room.\r\n\r\nSTANTZ\r\n\r\nHe peruses the room but sees nothing.  He looks up and scans the ceiling.\r\nA form flits behind a carved beam.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tThere!  On the ceiling!\r\n\t\t\t\t(the others look)\r\n\t\t\tCome on down here, you slug!\r\n\r\nStantz drops to one knee and fires at the vapor.\r\n\r\nTHE CEILING\r\n\r\nThe vapor dodges as the beam blasts a sizable chunk of plaster out of the\r\nceiling and destroys half the crystal chandelier.\r\n\r\nVENKMAN\r\n\r\nHe fires at it, too, wasting the rest of the chandelier but the vapor\r\ndodges away.  They are both ready to start blazing away again when\r\nSpengler stops them.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSPENGLER\r\n\t\t\t\t(urgently)\r\n\t\t\tWait!  Wait!

I'm taking charge.

This thing's not going to hang\r\n\t\t\taround all day waiting for us.  Ray, give me\r\n\t\t\tone stream wide right of it. I'll go wide\r\n\t\t\tleft.  Now!\r\n\r\nSTANTZ AND VENKMAN\r\n\r\nThey trigger their throwers and two streams are emitted, shooting off to\r\neither side of the entity.  The entity swirls but stays between the beams.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(talking them through it)\r\n\t\t\tGood ... Good ... Nice and wide ... Move\r\n\t\t\twith him ... Easy.  Hold steady.\r\n\r\nTHE VAPOR\r\n\r\nIt bobs and weaves, trying to slip past the visible lines of light, but\r\nVenkman and Stantz manage to keep it boxed in.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(speaking clearly)\r\n\t\t\tNow, very slowly, Ray, let's tighten it up.\r\n\t\t\tYou hold steady.

Watch it!\r\n\r\nSTANTZ\r\n\r\nThe vapor is trying to get around his streams, causing him to waver as\r\nVenkman's stream gets closer and closer.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tSpengler! A little help!  Cut him off.\r\n\r\nTHE VAPOR\r\n\r\nIt slips past Stantz and races for the air vent.\r\n\r\nSPENGLER\r\n\r\nHe fires with such poor marksmanship that he comes only centimeters from\r\ncrossing Venkman's stream. Venkman jerks away to avoid crossing Spengler's\r\nerratic bursts and maneuvers.  Together they do extensive damage to the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nINT. CORRIDOR -- SAME TIME\r\n\r\nThe Hotel Manager and the Maintenance Man look nervously at each other as\r\nthey hear the sound of heavy property damage coming from the banquet room.\r\n\r\nINT. BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\nStantz has the thing cornered to some extent.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\t\t(to Venkman)\r\n\t\t\tI'll nudge it out of the corner.

That's good.  Easy now.\r\n\r\nThey manage to guide the vapor out into the center of the room, all the\r\ntime closing the figurative box around it.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tIt's working!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSPENGLER\r\n\t\t\tEasy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my\r\n\t\t\ttrap now.\r\n\r\nSpengler jerks his leg up, triggering a release on his equipment belt.  A\r\ncord and foot pedal fall to the floor.  At the end of the cord there is a\r\nlong, flat black metal box two feet long, four inches wide and two high.\r\nHe kicks the box under the apparition and toes the foot pedal into\r\nposition. The apparition blasts them with a flatulent gust.  They recoil\r\nbut hold the configuration.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tEasy ... Easy ... Open the trap now!!\r\n\r\nSpengler stomps on the foot pedal and with a loud electronic snap the long\r\nmetal box on the floor sprays up a fixed multidimensional inverted pyramid\r\nof bright, beaded white light.\r\n\r\nStantz and Venkman herd the vapor to the top of the trap.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tWatch it ... Watch it ... Now!\r\n\r\nSpengler stomps the foot pedal again.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there is a loud double electronic snap and a blinding flash of\r\npink light. Wisps of brown smoke and carbonized particles rise to the\r\nceiling in a large residual puff. The Ghostbusters stand there for a long\r\nmoment not quite sure the battle is over.\r\n\r\nSPENGLER\r\n\r\nHe cautiously approaches the trap end looks at the valence indicator on\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSPENGLER\r\n\t\t\t\t(confirms it)\r\n\t\t\tHe's in here.\r\n\r\nSTANTZ AND VENKMAN\r\n\r\nThey whoop in triumph -- and considerable relief.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\t\t(pulling off his slimy\r\n\t\t\t\tvisor)\r\n\t\t\tWell!

LOBBY -- NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe elevator opens and the Ghostbusters emerge.  Stantz holds the trap by\r\nit's foot pedal.  He dangles it away from his body as if it is something\r\nputrid.  The Hotel Manager approaches them.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHOTEL MANAGER\r\n\t\t\tWhat happened?  Did you see it?  What is it?\r\n\r\nStantz removes his infra visor and wipes some slime off his face.

System shut.\r\n\r\nHe pushes more buttons and the slot lights up.  Several grating electronic\r\nsnaps are heard, like the sound of bugs being fried on an outdoor insect\r\nlight.  Then Stantz withdraws the trap and tosses it into a bin marked:\r\nFOR RECHARGE.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSPENGLER (CONT'D)\r\n\t\t\tI've got to sleep.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tI need two new purge valves.

According to this morning's\r\n\t\t\tPKE sample, the current level in the city\r\n\t\t\twould be a Twinkie 35 feet long weighing\r\n\t\t\tapproximately six hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWINSTON\r\n\t\t\tThat's a big Twinkie.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tWe could be on the verge of a fourfold\r\n\t\t\tcrossover ... or worse.  If what we're\r\n\t\t\tseeing indicates a massive PKE surge, we\r\n\t\t\tcould experience an actual rip.\r\n\r\nSpengler nods gravely.

It's too depressing.\r\n\r\nTHE MONITOR.\r\n\r\nWe zoom in on the monitor and get our first real look inside the storage\r\nfacility.  It is a bleak repository for souls of many species.  Strange\r\nlights, mists and spectral shapes waft about aimlessly.  Human-like\r\nfigures lean against the walls in despairing convict poses.  Others flit\r\nand hang on the ceiling.  It is a sad and frightening limbo and a most\r\nunholy makeshift asylum.\r\n\r\nEXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE -- NIGHT\r\n\r\nA mysterious cloud takes shape and hovers over Dana's apartment building.\r\nThen a strange glow starts to radiate from the temple-like structure on\r\nthe roof.\r\n\r\nEXT. THE TEMPLE -- NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe moon shines through the odd cloud configuration, illuminating the\r\nornate temple door with its two stone Terror Dogs posed rampant on either\r\nside of the portal.\r\n\r\nTERROR DOG\r\n\r\nIts hideous stone features are bathed in moonlight.  The camera PANS down\r\nits grotesque body to one of its claws.  Suddenly there is a hiss and an\r\naudible crack of disintegrating mortar as one of its stone talons comes to\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nITS HEAD\r\n\r\nThe stone figure opens its eyes, revealing glowing red pupils beneath the\r\nscaly lids.\r\n\r\nINT.

She sits down in an overstuffed chair and\r\ntakes off her leg warmers.  Then leans back and closes her eyes.  It is\r\nvery quiet.  Something dreadful is about to happen. Then it happens. The\r\nphone rings so loudly it makes Dana jump.  She picks it up.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDANA\r\n\t\t\tHello ... Oh, hi Mom.  Yes ... yes.\r\n\t\t\tEverything's fine.  No ... nothing.

THE KITCHEN DOOR   NIGHT\r\n\r\nAn eerie light is seen coming through the cracks around the door.\r\n\r\nDANA\r\n\r\nShe sits up in surprise and looks at the kitchen door.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDANA\r\n\t\t\tOh, shit!\r\n\r\nShe starts to get up but suddenly a pair of scaly, inhuman hands rip out\r\nof the chair cushion on either side of her and clutch her around the\r\nwaist.  She screams and tries to break their grip, but another pair of\r\nclaws tears through the upholstery and grabs her around the chest and\r\nneck, pinning her to the chair.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAIR\r\n\r\nAs if drawn by a powerful force, the chair with Dana in it slides across\r\nthe living room floor toward the kitchen door.\r\n\r\nTHE KITCHEN DOOR\r\n\r\nThe whole door is now pulsing.\r\n\r\nDANA\r\n\r\nShe is horrified.\r\n\r\nTHE KITCHEN DOOR\r\n\r\nIt swings open, revealing a fiery chamber where the kitchen used to be.\r\nOne of the Terror Dog creatures seen earlier in the fridge is standing\r\nthere waiting for Dana with outstretched claws.\r\n\r\nDANA\r\n\r\nShe screams as the chair propels her into the kitchen.

BEDROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\nOn the bed, standing up on all four legs, is a bristling, panting, live\r\nTerror Dog.  Too preoccupied to notice it, Louis reflexively tosses the\r\ncoats onto the bed.

THEATER\r\n\r\nThe house is packed with hooting, jeering, beer-drinking potsmoking\r\ndowntowners, all wearing cardboard 3-D glasses. They are wildly razzing\r\nand throwing things at the screen on which is running a bad sixties\r\nBritish horror indie pic.  The film breaks. The sound crackles off and the\r\nlights come on. There is a storm of protest and abuse hurled at the\r\nprojectionist.  Then from all around them there starts a thin whistling\r\nwhine.  It builds above the shouts and jeers in the theater until everyone\r\nstops to hear what it is. It is like no other sound ever heard -- a\r\npiercing, all-permeating shrill whistle like the fan blades of some\r\nmassive unseen turbine beginning to rotate.\r\n\r\nThe lights in the theater flicker. The musty ancient curtains on either\r\nside of the screen are picked up in an unseen wind which lifts them,\r\nspreading dust and ripped old fabric about the house.  There are shouts\r\nand sounds and noises from deep beyond the recesses of the backstage.  The\r\ncurtains are now flying in a serious wind.  All the lights in the theater\r\ngo out except that from the projection booth.  From a point in the center\r\nof the screen, a searing bolt of phosphorescent light rips back along the\r\nprojection beam into the booth.  The beam evolves into an etheric strand\r\nof unified glistening particles.  The wind dies down.  People in the house\r\nare hushed.  They gaze transfixed as a procession of phantasms emerge in\r\nsingle file through the illuminated screen.  As if suspended on a\r\nclothesline, they weave and bounce along the length of the pulsating beam,\r\nand pass through the hole in the projection booth.  The apparition is\r\ngone. All is quiet.

Ray, what did you think of?\r\n\r\nBROADWAY AND 55TH\r\n\r\nThe massive white shape passes behind some buildings, offering a glimpse\r\nof what appears to be a fat, white arm.\r\n\r\nSTANTZ\r\n\r\nHe's about to go into shock.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\t\t(babbling)\r\n\t\t\tIt can't be!

It's the STAY-PUFT\r\n\t\t\tMARSHMALLOW MAN.\r\n\r\nWinston, Venkman and Spengler gape.\r\n\r\nTHEIR POV\r\n\r\nThey look across the roof tops and see a large, square, white, bobbing,\r\nlaughing head atop a massive body of similar puffed white squares.  The\r\nbeing is dressed in a tiny sailor's hat, red bosun's whistle and lanyard\r\nand a little blue vest with a button undone in the middle revealing a\r\nlittle white belly. It is the cute, quintessential American brand symbol,\r\nlooming as large as Godzilla.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ (V.O.)\r\n\t\t\t\t(desperately apologizing)\r\n\t\t\tI tried to think of the most harmless thing\r\n\t\t\t... something that could never destroy us\r\n\t\t\t... something I loved from my childhood.\r\n\r\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\r\n\r\nThey watch the Marshmallow Man plodding toward them.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tAND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tThe Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on\r\n\t\t\tall the packages we used to buy when I was\r\n\t\t\ta kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft\r\n\t\t\tmarshmallows at Camp Waconda!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tGreat!  The marshmallows are about to get\r\n\t\t\ttheir revenge.\r\n\r\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\r\n\r\nHe plods relentlessly uptown toward the Ghostbusters' rooftop vantage\r\npoint.  The ground rumbles as his big, soft feet come down on the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nTHE STREET\r\n\r\nPeople are fleeing in panic as the marshmallow feet pad along kicking over\r\nlampposts and mail boxes.\r\n\r\nA CAR\r\n\r\nThe driver jumps out just before an enormous white marshmallow foot comes\r\ndown and flattens his automobile.\r\n\r\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\r\n\r\nThey stand there helplessly watching the laughing bobbing head of the\r\nStay-Puft Man as he comes toward them.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tWhat now?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSPENGLER\r\n\t\t\t\t(adjusting his thrower)\r\n\t\t\tFull-stream with strogon pulse.\r\n\r\nVenkman looks at Stantz.

THE STREET\r\n\r\nPeck comes running up to the front of the apartment building.  People are\r\nfleeing the oncoming monster.  Peck grabs a COP who is just about to flee\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPECK\r\n\t\t\t\t(in a rage)\r\n\t\t\tAre the Ghostbusters up there?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCOP\r\n\t\t\t\t(desperate to get away)\r\n\t\t\tYeah!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPECK\r\n\t\t\tI want you to go up on the roof and arrest\r\n\t\t\tthem.  This time they've gone too far.\r\n\r\nThe Cop looks at Peck like he's insane, then sees the Stay-Puft Man\r\nlooming up at the end of the block.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCOP\r\n\t\t\t\t(knocking Peck's hands\r\n\t\t\t\taway)\r\n\t\t\tYou arrest them, numb nuts!  I'm getting out\r\n\t\t\tof here.\r\n\r\nHe runs off.  Peck turns to face the monster.\r\n\r\nTHE STAY PUFT MAN\r\n\r\nThe ground shakes with every step as he reaches the building. Then, using\r\nthe church next door as a stepping stone, he begins climbing the wall.\r\n\r\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\r\n\r\nThey look over the edge of the roof as the Marshmallow Man climbs higher\r\nand higher.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(shouts)\r\n\t\t\tHit him!\r\n\r\nThey each fire point blank at the Stay-Puft Man.\r\n\r\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\r\n\r\nHe bellows with pain and rage as the beams strike him right in the chest\r\nand set his skin on fire.  He begins to burn with a blue flame that\r\nspreads quickly across his torso and down his arms.  The Stay-Puft Man\r\nbellows even louder, flailing its huge arms in response to the searing\r\nflames that are starting to engulf him.\r\n\r\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\r\n\r\nThey stare at the horrible conflagration.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWINSTON\r\n\t\t\tGood.  Now we made him mad.\r\n\r\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\r\n\r\nCarbonous, flaming hunks of melting marshmallow are flying from his arms\r\nas he waves them in wild rage.\r\n\r\nTHE STREET\r\n\r\nPeck stands there paralyzed with fear.  A mass of flaming marshmallow\r\nfalls and flattens a news stand nearby.  Then a huge glob of sticky\r\ntoasted marshmallow comes zipping down from above and lands right on him,\r\nburying him up to his neck in melted sucrose.\r\n\r\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\r\n\r\nThe flaming monster keeps coming intent on their destruction.  Most of his\r\nchest has melted away revealing horrid musculature and a skeletal rib\r\ncage.\r\n\r\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\r\n\r\nThey square off and face him for the last time, their weapons poised.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(calmly)\r\n\t\t\tWe're going to be killed by a hundred-foot\r\n\t\t\tmarshmallow.\r\n\r\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\r\n\r\nHe is almost on them now, fully engulfed in flames, reaching for them,\r\nready to swat them with his burning fist.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(to the others)\r\n\t\t\tOn the count of three!  One ... Two ...\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSPENGLER\r\n\t\t\t\t(he has the best idea of\r\n\t\t\t\this life)\r\n\t\t\tNo!  Them!  Shoot them!\r\n\t\t\t\t(he points at the Terror\r\n\t\t\t\tDogs)\r\n\t\t\tCross the beams.\r\n\r\nTHE TERROR DOGS\r\n\r\nThey stand beside the portal literally petrified.\r\n\r\nVENKMAN\r\n\r\nHe hesitates.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(protesting)\r\n\t\t\tNo!  You said crossing the beams would be\r\n\t\t\tBAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSPENGLER\r\n\t\t\tLife is just a state of mind.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tBut it's my favorite state.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tEither way we're history.\r\n\r\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\r\n\r\nHis burning fist is starting to descend on the Ghostbusters.\r\n\r\nVENKMAN\r\n\r\nHe chooses the only way out.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(shouts)\r\n\t\t\tNow!!\r\n\r\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\r\n\r\nThey turn and fire at the two petrified Terror Dogs and blow them to\r\noblivion. The entire front of the temple is obliterated along with the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\r\n\r\nWith the destruction of his earthly portal, the flaming monster is\r\nsuddenly engulfed in a cyclonic wind that begins to swirl around him like\r\na fire-storm.  The flames are whipped higher and higher as the tornado\r\nbegins to pick up rotational speed. Then the Marshmallow Man seems to\r\nexplode from deep inside creating a flaming air burst high above the\r\nrooftops.\r\n\r\nTHE ROOFTOP\r\n\r\nThe Ghostbusters are blasted off their feet.\r\n\r\nTHE SKY\r\n\r\nThe fireball reaches its maximum explosive force, then a sudden jet of air\r\npressure occurs like a titanic vacuum cleaner in the sky and sucks the\r\nflaming mass of gasses and ash up through our atmosphere and right out of\r\nour dimension.  The dark clouds disappear with it, leaving a beautiful\r\nclear blue sky over the whole area.\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE\r\n\r\nIt now looks like an ancient ruin.\r\n\r\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\r\n\r\nThey are lying at the foot of the stairs. Everything is still.  One by one\r\nthey get slowly to their feet and look around to see that the crisis has\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tEverybody okay?\r\n\r\nVenkman looks up at the portal.\r\n\r\nTHE TERROR DOGS\r\n\r\nThey are still on the pedestals but charred almost beyond recognition.\r\nVenkman mounts the stairs and gazes sadly at the remains.\r\n\r\nTHE PEDESTAL\r\n\r\nVenkman stands there mourning, then a slight movement under the blackened\r\nskin of the Terror Dog catches his eye.  The movement gets stronger, then\r\nsuddenly a human hand pokes through the carbonous coating.\r\n\r\nVENKMAN\r\n\r\nHope surges in him and he starts frantically tearing away the black\r\ncoating, finally revealing Dana alive and well under the burnt skin of the\r\nTerror Dog.\r\n\r\nSTANTZ AND SPENGLER\r\n\r\nThey peel the charred coating off Louis and help him to his feet.\r\n\r\nLOUIS\r\n\r\nHe looks around wondering how he ended up on the roof of a wrecked\r\nhigh-rise. He looks at his scorched and ripped suit crusted with the\r\nstill-smoking gobs of melted marshmallow.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOUIS\r\n\t\t\t\t(amazed)\r\n\t\t\tJeez!  Somebody must have spiked the egg\r\n\t\t\tsalad.\r\n\r\nVENKMAN\r\n\r\nHe helps Dana to her feet.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tAre you all right?\r\n\r\nShe looks around at the incredible scene.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDANA\r\n\t\t\t\t(totally confused)\r\n\t\t\tOh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOUIS\r\n\t\t\t\t(seeing Dana for the first\r\n\t\t\t\ttime)\r\n\t\t\tI'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never\r\n\t\t\ttouched you.  Not that I remember anyway.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDANA\r\n\t\t\t\t(getting annoyed)\r\n\t\t\tAll right, what happened to me?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tNothing!  We just got rid of that thing in\r\n\t\t\tyour kitchen.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDANA\r\n\t\t\tReally!  Is it gone?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tYeah, along with most of your furniture and\r\n\t\t\ta lot of your personal possessions.  This\r\n\t\t\tone took some work.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDANA\r\n\t\t\t\t(noting the wrecked temple)\r\n\t\t\tThank you.  Next time I want to break a\r\n\t\t\tlease I'll know who to call.\r\n\r\nShe hugs him.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\r\n\t\t\tThis is going to cost you, you know.  Our\r\n\t\t\tfees are ridiculously high.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDANA\r\n\t\t\tTalk to my accountant.\r\n\t\t\t\t(she indicates Louis)\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOUIS\r\n\t\t\tOh, great!  I bet we could write off all the\r\n\t\t\tdamage as an Act of God.\r\n\r\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\r\n\r\nThey look at each other and nod.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSTANTZ\r\n\t\t\tI'll go along with that.\r\n\r\nEXT. STREET - NEAR THE APARTMENT - NIGHT THE TWO BUMS\r\n\r\nThey hear the cheering down the street as they cautiously inspect a\r\nmassive mound of cooling sucrose.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFIRST BUM\r\n\t\t\tWell, that definitely looks like marshmallow\r\n\t\t\tto me.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSECOND BUM\r\n\t\t\t\t(sniffing it)\r\n\t\t\tYeah, it's some kind of mallow-type\r\n\t\t\tsubstance - that's for sure.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFIRST BUM\r\n\t\t\tYou have to wonder why anybody would dump a\r\n\t\t\tmarshmallow that size right in the middle of\r\n\t\t\tthe street.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSECOND BUM\r\n\t\t\tI wonder if there might not be a very large\r\n\t\t\tcup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFIRST BUM\r\n\t\t\tThat would definitely explain it.\r\n\r\nEXT. THE STREET   NIGHT\r\n\r\nA happy throng of jubilant citizens is gathered outside the lobby entrance\r\nto the apartment building.\r\n\r\nTHE ENTRANCE\r\n\r\nThe battered but victorious Ghostbusters emerge from the lobby.  Venkman\r\nand Dana are holding hands.  The crowd roars with unrestrained joy and\r\ngratitude,  Janine runs over and hugs Spengler enthusiastically.  The\r\nGhostbusters wave and head for the Ectomobile parked at the curb.\r\n\r\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\r\n\r\nThey get into the Ectomobile and drive off with lights flashing and sirens\r\nscreaming as the crowd cheers wildly.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTHE END\r\n\r\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Extract Text From Multiple Web Pages\n\nLet's quickly demonstrate how we might extract the screenplay text for every URL in the DataFrame.

They couldn't be \r\n          having a better time.\r\n          \r\n          AT THE BAR\r\n          \r\n          Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks \r\n          across the bouncing surge of the crowd.

With his other hand, Jordy whips out a\r\n\tBROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind\r\n\tthe mugger's head.

MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n\tThe roof is gone.  The sky is exposed.  It's charred ruins,\r\n\tsmoked beams and watery muck.  Eddie and Leon are standing by\r\n\twhat's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's\r\n\tcharred bodies.  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar,\r\n\tlistening to Leon.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLEON\r\n\t\tSo, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine\r\n\t\tposition - that they were doin' each\r\n\t\tother but were so whacked out of their\r\n\t\theads they set the pipe on the mattress,\r\n\t\tlit it up, and they got fried.

Part of\r\n\t\tthe job is picking up scents.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEDDIE\r\n\t\tOh, sure.\r\n\r\n\tEddie puts his cigar out.  Carefully slides it into a cigar\r\n\tholder and pockets it to finish later.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLEON\r\n\t\tWell, I found - check it out - crack\r\n\t\tpipe.  Looks like they got careless.\r\n\r\n\tLeon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs.

Eddie\r\n\trummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and\r\n\tliving room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a\r\n\tcharred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tKORFIN\r\n\t\tOkay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got\r\n\t\tgood patterns - about thirty minutes\r\n\t\told.\r\n\r\n\tJordy moves to one of the corpses.  He pulls on a white\r\n\trubber glove.  Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth.  The\r\n\tglove comes out white.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tMouth's clean, too.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tKORFIN\r\n\t\tClean?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tDon't blow your nose!\r\n\r\n\tJordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tThe smoke'll permeate your nostrils -\r\n\t\tburn 'em out.  Let it run.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tKORFIN\r\n\t\tBut you knew that, right?\r\n\r\n\tLeon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief.  Jordy\r\n\tturns back to the corpses on the bed.  Eddie - in the other\r\n\troom - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tSo the way you see it, two crack heads\r\n\t\tburned themselves up?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLEON\r\n\t\tThat's what it looks like to me.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tAnd while they're burning up, they're\r\n\t\tstill goin' down on each other?  You got\r\n\t\tto hand it to them.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLEON\r\n\t\t\t(realizes he's wrong - blows it\r\n\t\t\t off)\r\n\t\tYeah, well, some people got their\r\n\t\tpriorities straight.\r\n\r\n\tLeon watches Jordy, quietly.  With a pair of tweezers, Jordy\r\n\tpulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the\r\n\theads.  Korfin supplies the paint can.  Jordy drops the cloth\r\n\tinside.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLEON (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tWhat was that?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tEvidence.  Of a homicide.\r\n\r\n\tThat got Eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tYou know what that is, right?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEDDIE\r\n\t\tNo, what is it?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tWhy don't you explain it, Bobby.\r\n\t\t\t(to a fireman joking a wall)\r\n\t\tHey Camello!

Don't wanna get\r\n\t\tyour pants wet.\r\n\r\n\tLeon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV\r\n\tset.  Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon.  As Camello\r\n\thacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the\r\n\tbodies and Korfin explains:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tKORFIN\r\n\t\tThey have not soot in their mouths,\r\n\t\twhich means they weren't breathin'\r\n\t\tbefore the fire and that usually means\r\n\t\tthey were deceased - and this piece of\r\n\t\tcloth that my partner found means they\r\n\t\twere wrapped up in something, probably\r\n\t\tdoused with a flammable liquid and\r\n\t\tpositioned like this on the bed.  To the\r\n\t\tuntrained eye, it looks like an\r\n\t\taccident.\r\n\r\n\tJordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for\r\n\tsomething.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLEON\r\n\t\tWhat's he looking for?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEDDIE\r\n\t\tA timer.\r\n\r\n\tJordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up -\r\n\ton the other end is a timer.

KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT\r\n\r\n\tAs the \"Top Story\" logo is splashed across the screen,\r\n\taccompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces\r\n\tAmerica's highest rated 'news magazine' show.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\r\n\t\tGood evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and\r\n\t\tthis is Top Story.  Tonight we bring you\r\n\t\tan exclusive interview with Stephen\r\n\t\tGeller - who horrified the nation two\r\n\t\tyears ago when he went berserk and\r\n\t\tmurdered three clerks in a Manhattan\r\n\t\tshoe store.  But now, Mr. Geller's\r\n\t\tclaim, spoken softly and articulately,\r\n\t\tis that he is the victim.  According to\r\n\t\tMr. Geller, the events of that fateful\r\n\t\tday were not his fault but were the\r\n\t\tfault of his psychiatrist.  Hard to\r\n\t\tbelieve...watch.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (O.S.)\r\n\t\tLouder.\r\n\r\n\tVIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting\r\n\ton the hotel bed watching the TV.  He looks at us.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tLouder.\r\n\r\n\tOleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the\r\n\tvolume.  The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being\r\n\tinterviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew.  He's\r\n\tsitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint\r\n\tstained shirt.  A showing of his artwork is displayed in the\r\n\tbackground.  Patients peruse the paintings of weird\r\n\tdysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact.  One of the\r\n\tpaintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\r\n\t\tThis had nothing to do with shoes that\r\n\t\tdidn't fit or my relationship with my\r\n\t\tfather who, as you know, made a fortune\r\n\t\tselling penny loafers in the fifties. \r\n\t\tThese people died because of the\r\n\t\tcriminal actions of my doctor.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\r\n\t\tYour doctor?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\r\n\t\tYes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that\r\n\t\tI stay on my medication.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\r\n\t\t...so you feel absolutely no\r\n\t\tresponsibility for killing these people?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\r\n\t\tIt was my finger that pulled the\r\n\t\ttrigger, but I'm not morally\r\n\t\tresponsible.  My psychiatrist knew what\r\n\t\tI was capable of.  How could I know. \r\n\t\tI'm not a doctor.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\r\n\t\tYou seem very savvy for a man who's been\r\n\t\tfound mentally incompetent to stand\r\n\t\ttrial.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\r\n\t\tLook, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a\r\n\t\tyear away from getting my masters in\r\n\t\tArt, now I'll never graduate.  My life\r\n\t\thas been permanently disrupted.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\r\n\t\tPermanently disrupted?  Aren't you\r\n\t\tselling paintings now for quite a lot of\r\n\t\tmoney?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you\r\n\t\tcall it, jump started your career as an\r\n\t\tartist?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\r\n\t\tLook, I'm in here.  You call this a\r\n\t\tcareer move?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\r\n\t\tAnd isn't there a movie in the works\r\n\t\tabout you?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\r\n\t\tWe're in negotiations, that's correct.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\r\n\t\tBut doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent\r\n\t\tcriminals from profiting from their\r\n\t\tcrimes?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\r\n\t\tThat doesn't apply to me because I'm not\r\n\t\ta criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I\r\n\t\twasn't convicted.\r\n\r\n\tEmil leans forward - listening.  Fascinated.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\r\n\t\tI love America.  No one is responsible\r\n\t\tfor what they do.\r\n\r\n\tThere's a KNOCK on the door.  Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over\r\n\tto it.  Then WHIPS back to Emil.

Our POV backs into the bathroom,\r\n\tclosing the door but leaving it open a crack.  Emil looks\r\n\tdown at his shoe.  The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife\r\n\tsticking out of Emil's BOOT.  Emil's hands pull his pants\r\n\tcuff over it.  POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door\r\n\tand opens it.

He\r\n\tWHIP PANS back to Honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking\r\n\tthe door but Emil's HAND SLAMS it shut!  Emil turns blindly,\r\n\trubbing his burning eyes - guarding the door.  Honey darts\r\n\ttoward the bathroom - she pushes open the door and runs into\r\n\tOleg who is VIDEOTAPING HER.  Horrified, she turns around as\r\n\tEmil SMASHES her in the face so hard she topples backwards,\r\n\ttripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on\r\n\ther!  Like a panther out for the kill, Emil POUNCES.  Oleg\r\n\tfilms as Emil lifts his hand, gripping...\r\n\r\n\tTHE KITCHEN KNIFE\r\n\r\n\tAs Emil's hand comes FLYING DOWN - then RISES UP, BLOODIED. \r\n\tHer screams are muffled by the shower curtain wrapped around\r\n\ther face.

NYC STREETS - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n\tWhat follows next is an incredible foot chase with Eddie,\r\n\tJordy, Korfin and Leon running through traffic - chasing\r\n\tEmil.  Eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of\r\n\tbreath.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEDDIE\r\n\t\tSplit up!\r\n\r\n\tJordy runs down one side of Madison - Eddie, the other. \r\n\tKorfin continues down 62nd and Leon covers the other side. \r\n\tThey search for Emil, grabbing people, turning them around,\r\n\tmissing him.  Emil seems to have disappeared.\r\n\r\n\tLeon, gun raised, approaches the cafe.  As he rounds the\r\n\tcorner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face!  Leon\r\n\tcrashes into a table, dropping his gun.  Emil scoops up the\r\n\tgun and PISTOL-WHIPS Leon.  BEATING the detective to a pulp. \r\n\tPeople are running from the scene.  Emil takes Leon's wallet. \r\n\tHe is distracted by LAUGHTER.  Oleg is VIDEOTAPING the scene.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOLEG\r\n\t\tEmil, look!\r\n\r\n\tOleg swivels with the videocamera.  Korfin is running toward\r\n\tthem - pushing through the crowd.  Emil FIRES!  Korfin is\r\n\tblown backwards.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOLEG (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tPerfect!  Cut.  Print!\r\n\r\n\tEddie arrives.  Bends down to Leon, whose face is red with\r\n\tblood.  Jordy runs to Korfin, who's laying in the street,\r\n\tshot in the side.  Jordy cradles his partner.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEDDIE\r\n\t\tAre you hit?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLEON\r\n\t\tNo.  I'm okay.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\t\t(to Korfin)\r\n\t\tBobby, Bobby!

Stay down, Bobby.\r\n\r\n\tJordy looks up as Eddie steps into the center of the street. \r\n\tCars screech out of the way!  Eddie crouches, taking aim at\r\n\tEmil, who is almost two blocks away.  It's an impossible\r\n\tshot, out of range.\r\n\r\n\tBut Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one SHOT.  Two\r\n\tblocks away, Emil topples.  Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie,\r\n\tastonished he made the shot.  Emil scrambles to his feet. \r\n\tRuns.  Eddie holsters his weapon.  Pulls out a handkerchief. \r\n\tDabs Leon's wounds.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLEON\r\n\t\tHe got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming\r\n\t\tthe whole time!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEDDIE\r\n\t\tI know.  Relax.

Almost giving in.  Then breaks\r\n\taway.  Gestures towards the showers. \r\n\tDaphne looks away form him - crestfallen.  She heads to the\r\n\tshowers.  Jordy follows her into the bathroom.

Looks down.  It's a two-story drop to the\r\n\tstreet.\r\n\r\n\tJORDY\r\n\r\n\tgets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He\r\n\tchecks the number but decides not to return the call.

No sign of her.  He turns -\r\n\tlooks back at the shower.  It's on but he can't see through\r\n\tthe curtain.  Can't tell if she's there.  He walks over -\r\n\tquickly - fearing that she's left.  He pulls the curtain\r\n\taside.  She's crouched in the corner shower stall.  Holding\r\n\therself.  She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tAre you alright?\r\n\r\n\tJordy sits on the bench next to the shower.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\r\n\t\tI'm not a whore.

Never being able to look\r\n\t\tanyone in the eyes. \r\n\t\tAlways afraid that someone would find\r\n\t\tout who I was.

Emil turns to Eddie.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tNo.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy\r\n\t\tmen would film their murders?\r\n\t\t\t(gestures to Eddie)\r\n\t\tSo we kill someone famous and if we are\r\n\t\tcaught, we are sent to mental hospital. \r\n\t\tBut what good is money there?  Because\r\n\t\tonce in hospital I say I not crazy. \r\n\t\tJust pretended to be acquitted.  We see\r\n\t\tpsychiatrists.  They must certify we are\r\n\t\tsane and because of your - what is law\r\n\t\tcalled?\r\n\t\t\t(Eddie says nothing)\r\n\t\tOh - I got it.  Because of your Double\r\n\t\tJeopardy law, we can't be tried for same\r\n\t\tcrime twice.

Not only\r\n\t\twill Americans believe me, they'll cry\r\n\t\tfor me.\r\n\t\t\t(laughs)\r\n\t\tSo...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you\r\n\t\tlike to say goodbye to your Nicolette? \r\n\t\tMaybe you can propose to her now?\r\n\r\n\tEddie says nothing.  Just stares at Emil.  Emil puffs on\r\n\tEddie's cigar.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tOkay.  He has nothing to say.\r\n\t\t\t(signaling Oleg)\r\n\t\tStart the camera!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOLEG\r\n\t\tCut!\r\n\r\n\tEmil looks at Oleg.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOLEG (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tThis is my project.  I say 'action.'  I\r\n\t\tam the director!  You are the talent. \r\n\t\tYou wait for me to say 'action!'\r\n\r\n\tEmil looks at Eddie as if to say, \"See what I have to put up\r\n\twith.\"  Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOLEG (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tAnd...action!\r\n\r\n\tOleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver.  Eddie\r\n\tsuddenly KICKS at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away,\r\n\tbacking out of Eddie's reach.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\r\n\t\tBad last moment - I cut that out.\r\n\r\n\tEmil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's\r\n\tleft temple.  Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the\r\n\tgun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm.  Standing\r\n\tand following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over\r\n\tinto the desk.  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and\r\n\tEmil falls off the desk and onto the floor.\r\n\r\n\tOleg still grips the videocamera.  Eddie continues around\r\n\twith the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning\r\n\thim to the wall.\r\n\r\n\tEddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as\r\n\tEmil is limping for it.  Eddie knocks Emil out of the way\r\n\twith the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair\r\n\trepeatedly.\r\n\r\n\tEddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him\r\n\tfrom the wall.  Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and\r\n\tonto the sofa.  Falling on top of him, rolling over and\r\n\tleaving Oleg on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\tEddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair\r\n\tin such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the\r\n\tgun.  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is\r\n\tnot clear in the darkness who has the gun.\r\n\r\n\tOleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the\r\n\tvideocamera.  Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up\r\n\tas Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting\r\n\ttoward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the\r\n\twindow and one of the lampshades off the lamp.\r\n\r\n\tOleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn\r\n\ttoward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in\r\n\tthe stomach.\r\n\r\n\tEmil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S\r\n\tSTOMACH.\r\n\r\n\tEddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to\r\n\tthe chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can't believe he got\r\n\tstabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can't be\r\n\tdying.  This can't be happening.  He looks at Emil.  The pain\r\n\tis terrible.  Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a\r\n\tclose up.\r\n\r\n\tEmil looks at Eddie.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tDie.  Die.\r\n\r\n\tEmil looks around.  Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie\r\n\toff, suffocating him.\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\tBLACKNESS\r\n\r\n\tWe are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you\r\n\tfeel is the motion.  We are travelling very fast.  Finally,\r\n\tin the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. \r\n\tWe slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a\r\n\ttiny pixel on a TV screen.\r\n\r\n\tWIDENING\r\n\r\n\tfurther out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news.  It's\r\n\tan enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and\r\n\tdignitaries.  In the upper right hand corner, superimposed\r\n\tover the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in\r\n\this NYPD uniform.  We see Oleg's reflection on the set with\r\n\tthe videocamera.  He is filming the TV.  We hear the audio\r\n\tfrom Eddie's funeral.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNEWSCASTER (ON T.V.)\r\n\t\t..Detective Flemming was one of the most\r\n\t\tdecorated NYPD detectives in the history\r\n\t\tof New York.  He made several thousand\r\n\t\tarrests during his career, including the\r\n\t\tfamed Stephen Geller case.  Beloved by\r\n\t\tthe community in which he served.  His\r\n\t\tpartner eulogized him...\r\n\r\n\tLeon is at the mic. \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLEON (ON T.V.)\r\n\t\t...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend\r\n\t\tand my partner...he taught me the\r\n\t\tmeaning of the word 'cop.'  He was a man\r\n\t\tin every sense of the word.  I'll miss\r\n\t\thim...\r\n\t\t\t(choking on tears)\r\n\t\tSleep well, brother.\r\n\r\n\tLeon begins to sing \"Amazing Grace.\"  Oleg PANS from the TV\r\n\tand focuses it on a lightbulb.  Hands enter the frame -\r\n\tcarefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray.  A long\r\n\thypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is\r\n\tpulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. \r\n\tGingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb.  Again,\r\n\tthe plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a\r\n\ttable...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE.  VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT\r\n\trevealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.\r\n\r\n\tINT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY\r\n\r\n\tIt's packed with COPS drinking.  Prosecutors...lawyers...many\r\n\twho were at the funeral, including Leon.  All wear the black\r\n\tribbon on their badges.  There's a quality of an Irish wake -\r\n\tboisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform.  A buffet\r\n\thas been laid out.\r\n\r\n\tHawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon.  He\r\n\tgreets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tAwful...what an awful day.  He was New\r\n\t\tYork City.\r\n\r\n\tHawkins notices a young man by the window.  Teary-eyed.  It's\r\n\tTommy.  Hawkins nods to him.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tTOMMY\r\n\t\tI never got to tell him how much I\r\n\t\tadmired him.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tI know, son, I know.  We all loved him.\r\n\r\n\tHawkins moves on...greeting others.  He notices at the end of\r\n\tthe bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette.  He moves\r\n\tto her.  Pulls up a stool alongside her.  She turns, looks at\r\n\thim.  Just stares at him for a long beat.  She is bombed. \r\n\tDefinitely drunk.  She's had many.  She turns to Hawkins.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\r\n\t\tYou know...you know he was gonna propose\r\n\t\tto me.  The crime guys found a card he'd\r\n\t\twritten out to me.  And a ring\r\n\t\tbox...these fuckers that killed him -\r\n\t\thave my ring.  They have my diamond\r\n\t\tengagement ring...\r\n\r\n\tHawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tI know.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\r\n\t\tWhat do you mean you know?

Go ahead.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tThat morning.  He was talking to me and\r\n\t\tLeon about marriage.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\r\n\t\tOh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. \r\n\t\tHe started making overtures - talking\r\n\t\tabout little shoes next to his in his\r\n\t\tcloset but I got a call to anchor - and\r\n\t\tI walked out on him.  I walked out on\r\n\t\thim when he was trying to ask me to\r\n\t\tmarry him!!\r\n\r\n\tNicolette is crying now.  She angrily wipes away a tear.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tI'd never had a great relationship\r\n\t\tbefore.  I'd never made great choices\r\n\t\twith men.  And he wasn't easy to get to\r\n\t\tknow.  He was older, my parents told me\r\n\t\tI was nuts to get involved with him. \r\n\t\tBut he was so great to me.  Always\r\n\t\tencouraging, telling me I could do\r\n\t\tanything...\r\n\t\t\t(beat)\r\n\t\tHe was the one.  You know, I'd give up\r\n\t\teverything - everything - for just a\r\n\t\tlittle more time.  I would've spent\r\n\t\tfifteen minutes with him if that's all I\r\n\t\tknew I had.\r\n\r\n\tShe's lost it.  Hawkins consoles her.  Nicolette shrugs him\r\n\toff - turns back to her drink.  Downs the rest of it.  A\r\n\twoman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAGGIE\r\n\t\tRobert...?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tWhat are you doing here?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAGGIE\r\n\t\t\t(holding a cellular)\r\n\t\tYou've got a call.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tI can't talk to anybody right now, can't\r\n\t\tyou see I'm busy!  I can't talk\r\n\t\tbusiness.  Hang up.  Have a drink.\r\n\t\t\t(to Paulie)\r\n\t\tGet her a whiskey.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAGGIE\r\n\t\tTrust me, you'll want to take this call.\r\n\r\n\tRobert steps off the stool.  Takes the phone.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tHello?  Who is this?\r\n\t\t\t(listens)\r\n\t\tHow do I know this is you?\r\n\r\n\tHawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder. \r\n\tBacks away from the bar.  Now out of hearing distance, he\r\n\tlooks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tWhere?\r\n\r\n\tWe INTERCUT Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie\r\n\ttheater.

Four o'clock\r\n\t\tgives you time to go to bank.  Three\r\n\t\thundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tWhat?

The line goes dead.  Hawkins disconnects.  Hands the\r\n\tphone back to Maggie.  She's looking at him.  Excited. \r\n\tHawkins looks at Nicolette.  His mind whirls.\r\n\r\n\tINT. FIRE STATION 91 - KITCHEN - DAY\r\n\r\n\tDaphne and Korfin are sitting at a table.  Korfin's arm is in\r\n\ta sling, his side bandaged.  Duffy and Jordy enter in their\r\n\tdress uniforms.

Jordy leads Daphne out of the station. \r\n\tKorfin follows.  A MAN IN A CHEAP SUIT is talking to Camello\r\n\twho points as Jordy walks by.  The man chases after Jordy.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAN\r\n\t\tExcuse me - Jordan Warsaw?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tYeah.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAN\r\n\t\t\t(shoving papers in Jordy's\r\n\t\t\t hand)\r\n\t\tConsider yourself served.\r\n\r\n\tJordy opens the papers.

DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\r\n\r\n\tIt's an old brownstone - in poor condition.  Jordy pulls up. \r\n\tOpens the door for Daphne - takes her by the elbow - steering\r\n\ther to the door.  He is edgy.  Jumpy.  Looking around.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\r\n\t\tAre you alright?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tI still can't believe Eddie's gone.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\r\n\t\tI'm sorry.\r\n\r\n\tHe looks at her.  Nods.  They walk up to the stairs as the\r\n\tfront door opens.  A NEIGHBOR exits, shocked.  Jordy pulls\r\n\tDaphne out of the way.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE (CONT'D)\r\n\t\t\t(in Czech to the man)\r\n\t\tHello.  How are you?\r\n\r\n\tINT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n\tJordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs.  A bouquet of\r\n\tflowers are outside Daphne's apartment.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tWhat's this?\r\n\r\n\tShe takes the card.  Jordy looks over her shoulder.

The sexual tension\r\n\tstrong.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tA good Immigration lawyer could stall\r\n\t\tthe process.

Passionately.  Somebody is coming up the stairs. \r\n\tThey part quickly.  A tenant enters his apartment down the\r\n\thall.  Jordy clears his throat.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tLet's get your stuff.\r\n\r\n\tHe opens the door.  Peers inside - checking it out.  Turns to\r\n\ther.

Another kiss. \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tYou better get packed.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\r\n\t\tRight.\r\n\r\n\tShe holds his look.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tDo you have coffee?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\r\n\t\tIn the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tI'll make some for us.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\r\n\t\tI'll get my clothes.\r\n\r\n\tShe heads down the hall.  Jordy enters the small kitchen.  He\r\n\tflips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES -\r\n\tSETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO\r\n\tTHE ROOM.  Jordy JUMPS BACK.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tJordy!!!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tNo!  Get back!  GET BACK!!!\r\n\r\n\tJordy's more surprised than shaken.  It's a fire - he knows\r\n\tthe drill.  He pushes her into the living room.  Then notices\r\n\ta FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall.  Grabs it.  Aims it\r\n\tat the FIRE spreading in the kitchen.  He SPRAYS as Daphne\r\n\tSCREAMS!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\r\n\t\tThat's not mine!\r\n\r\n\tWHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE!  Flames\r\n\tleap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher\r\n\tbecause it's filled with gasoline.  The handle LOCKS!  Jordy\r\n\tCAN'T TURN IT OFF.  Flames engulf the extinguisher and\r\n\tJORDY'S HAND.\r\n\r\n\tHe flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN. \r\n\tCloses the door.  Jordy takes off his jacket.  Stuffs it\r\n\tunder the bottom of the door.  Blocking the smoke.  He\r\n\thurries into the living room.  Knowing it's moments before\r\n\tthe extinguisher will explode.  Jordy pulls out his cellular. \r\n\tHits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a\r\n\tchair through the window.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tDon't!  It'll suck the flames toward us!\r\n\r\n\tToo late.  She SMASHES the window.  There's an EXPLOSION in\r\n\tthe kitchen.  Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along\r\n\tthe ceiling.  Jordy yells into the phone:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tThis is Jordan Warsaw!

As soon as the fire\r\n\tgets in the bathroom, everything will explode!\r\n\r\n\tJordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might. \r\n\tDaphne comes over - helps him.  Both of them trying to break\r\n\tit off.  Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room. \r\n\tSOAKING THE WALLS.

Welcome to \"Top Story\". \r\n\t\tTonight, I present to you material of a\r\n\t\tgraphic and violent nature never before\r\n\t\tseen on television.  And I do so with a\r\n\t\theavy heart.  You will be first-hand\r\n\t\twitness to the slaying of celebrated New\r\n\t\tYork City Homicide Detective, Eddie\r\n\t\tFlemming.  It would be only normal to\r\n\t\task, why?  Why are we showing something\r\n\t\tso journalist, I must show it.  A\r\n\t\tdemocracy survives through the freedom\r\n\t\tof its media, and if we cannot see what\r\n\t\tis happening then we don't deserve our\r\n\t\tdemocracy, or our freedom.  Eddie\r\n\t\tFlemming was my friend.  I cried when I\r\n\t\twatched this footage and vowed to fight\r\n\t\tthis violence with every molecule of my\r\n\t\tbeing from this day onward.  Hopefully,\r\n\t\tthis will have a similar effect on you. \r\n\t\tOne final word, this material is\r\n\t\tabsolutely not appropriate for children.\r\n\r\n\tThe restaurant BUZZES.

DESERTED STREET - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n\tThe car slows down.  Tommy watches Jordy, realizes what's\r\n\tgoing on.  Jordy stops at a dead end.

Climbs behind\r\n\tthe wheel and drives away, leaving Jordy and Emil alone in\r\n\tthe darkness.  Jordy takes out Eddie's pistol.  The one Emil\r\n\ttook from Eddie.  Jordy opens the cylinder - two bullets\r\n\tleft.  Jordy snaps the cylinder shut, tucks Eddie's gun in\r\n\tEmil's belt.  He drags Emil away from the wall, into the\r\n\tcenter of the empty space - unlocks Emil's handcuffs and\r\n\tthrows them aside.  Still holding the gun on Emil, he circles\r\n\taround to face him.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tGet your hands up!  Get your hands up!\r\n\r\n\tNow facing Emil, he sticks his gun in his waistband - the\r\n\tsame place he put Emil's.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tYou wanna be a real American?

We all want him\r\n\t\tdead but you can't do it this way.\r\n\r\n\tEmil is still smiling.  Jordy suddenly slams Emil in the\r\n\tface.  Knocking him to the floor.  He jumps in his car and\r\n\tspeeds away.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tINT.

We've\r\n\t\tgot a good relationship with the Czech's\r\n\t\tand the State Department doesn't want to\r\n\t\tcause an incident.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tBut the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\r\n\t\tThey've got her testimony on videotape. \r\n\t\tAnd even if they do take her to court\r\n\t\timmediately after she'll be extradited. \r\n\t\tThe Czechs want her back.  She shot a\r\n\t\tcop!  I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil\r\n\t\tSlovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech\r\n\t\tRepublic?  How would you feel if the\r\n\t\tCzechs wouldn't give them back to us?!\r\n\r\n\tStern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office.  Lowers\r\n\this voice.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSTERN (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tAnd just between us...I was married to a\r\n\t\tredhead.  They're a jinx.  Redheads are\r\n\t\tlike cross-eyed priests.  Stay away from\r\n\t\tboth.\r\n\r\n\tJordy gives him a look.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSTERN (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tYou want to see her - go ahead.\r\n\r\n\tJordy enters the other office.  Sits next to Daphne.  The\r\n\tassistant U.S. Attorneys leave.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tWe're gonna fight the extradition.\r\n\r\n\tDaphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\r\n\t\tForget about me.  You have enough\r\n\t\tproblems of your own.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\t...Do you really want me to forget about\r\n\t\tyou?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\r\n\t\tI don't want to drag you down with me.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tDaphne, I...\r\n\r\n\tDaphne touches her finger to his lips.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\r\n\t\tShhhh.\r\n\r\n\tShe leans in and kisses him.  Then looks into his eyes,\r\n\ttrying to find a smile.\r\n\r\n\tEXT. FEDERAL COURT HOUSE STEPS - DAY\r\n\r\n\tIt's weeks later.  Nicolette is looking worn, tired,\r\n\tfrazzled.  She's trying to go through her stand up.  But\r\n\tshe's unraveling.  Not recovered from the loss of Eddie.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE \r\n\t\t...and today with his partner who he\r\n\t\tblamed for the crimes still at large,\r\n\t\tEmil Slovak will appear in court.  His\r\n\t\tlawyer will argue that he is mentally \r\n\t\tunfit to stand trial.  Eyewitness News\r\n\t\thas also learned that later this month,\r\n\t\tJordy Warsaw will himself be appearing\r\n\t\tin court.  He will be arraigned on\r\n\t\tcharges of violating the civil rights\r\n\t\tof...Zwangen...Zwagen...\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMIKE\r\n\t\tZwangendaba.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\r\n\t\tGoddamn assholes everywhere. \r\n\t\tZwangenbobby..Zwangendaba.  I got it. \r\n\t\tI'll do it.  Shit.  Let's start again. \r\n\t\t5-4-3-2-1...\r\n\r\n\tShe starts over.\r\n\r\n\tINT. JORDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n\tJordy's on the couch.  A drink in his hand, watching TV with\r\n\this dog, ZACK.  Jordy's eyes are glazed.  He's drunk, his\r\n\teyes are as bloodshot as Eddie's were...without his job or\r\n\tDaphne. \r\n\tHis mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort. \r\n\tAs Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger\r\n\tseeps through her broadcast.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (ON T.V.)\r\n\t\tMr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct\r\n\t\tdescendent of the African King from whom\r\n\t\the takes his name...\r\n\r\n\tJordy's face is flashed on screen.  The phone RINGS.  Jordy\r\n\tpicks up.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tHello?\r\n\t\t\t(listens)\r\n\t\tNo comment.\r\n\r\n\tHe hangs up.  The phone RINGS AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tHello?\r\n\t\t\t(listens)\r\n\t\tNo!\r\n\r\n\tJordy hangs up.  Changes the channel.  He stops as Robert\r\n\tHawkins' face fills the screen.  He is standing across from\r\n\tsomeone - in a park - interviewing him.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS (ON T.V.)\r\n\t\tHe robbed you?\r\n\r\n\tThe ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a\r\n\tsuit and tie.  Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut.  He\r\n\tstands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the\r\n\ttree.  He's appearing on \"Top Story\".\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.)\r\n\t\tThat's right, I encountered him right\r\n\t\there.  I was just askin' for change an'\r\n\t\the whips out his big gun an' pushes me\r\n\t\tup against that tree, whereupon he takes\r\n\t\tmy money and handcuffs me to it, leavin'\r\n\t\tme there all exposed...\r\n\r\n\tThe phone RINGS again.  Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off\r\n\tthe table and throws it through the window:\r\n\r\n\tBACK TO TV\r\n\r\n\tas the channel is changed.  A REPORTER is on TV.  Behind him\r\n\tis a picture of Emil.  Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie. \r\n\tThe reporter stands in front of the jail.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tREPORTER\r\n\t\t...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak\r\n\t\twon't have to worry about how he is\r\n\t\tgoing to pay for his defense.  He has\r\n\t\treceived movie offers and been in\r\n\t\tconversations with numerous publishers\r\n\t\tconcerning the rights to his life story.\r\n\r\n\tREVERSE ANGLE\r\n\r\n\tOleg is at a bar watching TV.  Poisoned with envy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tINT. JORDY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING\r\n\r\n\tJordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser.  We see\r\n\tthe TV overturned in the b.g.  His back up gun is on it.  He\r\n\tstares at it.  Dark thoughts dancing in his head.\r\n\r\n\tEXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY\r\n\r\n\tJordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses.  Looking inside the\r\n\tpark where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT. \r\n\tCutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to\r\n\tRykers Island.  Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster\r\n\tand sticks it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\tCLOSE ON METER\r\n\r\n\tto $42.00.  The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tTAXI DRIVER\r\n\t\tI can't believe this guy got off. \r\n\t\tUnbelievable.\r\n\r\n\tJordy takes out money.  All he's got is fifty bucks and he\r\n\tcrams it into the slot.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tWhatever's leftover, keep.\r\n\r\n\tJordy exits the cab.  The anger rising inside his body is\r\n\tcoming to a boiling point.  He walks into the park.  Leon is\r\n\tsitting on a bench.  Just sitting there.  Also filled with\r\n\trage and frustration.  Jordy meets his eyes.  Leon gets up\r\n\tand walks away.  Disgusted by it all.  Jordy's right hand\r\n\tgrips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.\r\n\r\n\tHIGH WIDE SHOT\r\n\r\n\tMany policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. \r\n\tAll are waiting for Emil.  WE SEE:\r\n\r\n\tHAWKINS\r\n\r\n\tand his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and\r\n\tfrazzled, waits Nicolette.  Still grieving her loss, she\r\n\tlooks over at Hawkins and his crew.  She shoots him a\r\n\tdisgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off.  He checks his watch -\r\n\tanxious - looks at his cameraman.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tHe said he'd be here.  Pick him up as he\r\n\t\tcomes through the crowd.  Do you hear\r\n\t\tme?  For Chrissakes don't miss this.\r\n\r\n\tTHE POLICE VAN PULLS UP\r\n\r\n\tCutler's car behind it.  Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from\r\n\tthe van.  Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his\r\n\tcar, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the\r\n\tPOLICE ESCORTS.  The swarm follows - firing questions at\r\n\tCutler.  He answers the barrage of questions with:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCUTLER\r\n\t\t...my client was suffering from a major\r\n\t\tillness of schizophrenic nature wherein\r\n\t\tduring times of intense stress, as a\r\n\t\tresult of paranoid and psychotic\r\n\t\tdelusions - there was impairment of his\r\n\t\tability to appreciate wrongfullness...\r\n\t\tThis is a victory for the mentally ill!\r\n\r\n\tJordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused on\r\n\tEmil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Max,\r\n\tthe celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What's he doing here? \r\n\tMax's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird gleam\r\n\tin his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other\r\n\tcops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their\r\n\tplace in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.  Cutler\r\n\tcontinues:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCUTLER (CONT'D)\r\n\t\t...before Emil boards the police boat\r\n\t\tand heads for Rykers Island where he\r\n\t\twill be checked into the psyche ward, I\r\n\t\twant to say one last word to you all...\r\n\t\tAs you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg\r\n\t\tRazgul into committing these murders,\r\n\t\tyet Oleg is still out in the street, a\r\n\t\tfree man, filming gruesome murders... My\r\n\t\tclient and I hope he is brought to\r\n\t\tjustice in the near future.\r\n\r\n\tThey are through the monuments, approaching the steps when\r\n\tJordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch\r\n\tobsessively.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tWhere the hell is he?  Goddamn it?!\r\n\r\n\tJordy glares at Emil.  Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. \r\n\tSmiles.  He won.  He beat the system.  Jordy suddenly erupts.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tYou think this is funny??  What the hell\r\n\t\tare you laughing at?\r\n\r\n\tEmil stares down Jordy.  Jordy grips the gun inside the\r\n\tjacket.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCUTLER\r\n\t\t\t(to a nearby escort)\r\n\t\tOfficer, keep this man back, he's\r\n\t\tassaulted my client on previous\r\n\t\toccasions.\r\n\r\n\tA PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tThis is it?  This bastard kills the best\r\n\t\tcop this city ever had and we do\r\n\t\tnothing?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCUTLER\r\n\t\tYou may not like it marshal, but that's\r\n\t\tthe law.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tAnd what about the other victims??  What\r\n\t\tabout their families?  He'll end up in\r\n\t\tsome country club nuthouse while his\r\n\t\tlawyer sells his rights to the movies\r\n\t\tand we just stand here and do nothing? \r\n\t\tWe let this scumbag walk?\r\n\r\n\tJordy moves past the officer.  Emil breaks away from Cutler. \r\n\tGets in Jordy's face.  Laughs quietly.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\r\n\t\tBe careful.  I can kill you.  I'm\r\n\t\tinsane.\r\n\r\n\tJordy shoves Emil into Cutler.  A scuffle breaks out as the\r\n\tcops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:\r\n\r\n\tA VIDEO POV\r\n\r\n\tas it approaches Hawkins from behind.  A hand dips into frame\r\n\ttapping Hawkins on the shoulder.  Hawkins turns - sees who\r\n\the's been waiting for.  His face lights up.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tI thought you wouldn't show up.  Where\r\n\t\tis it?  Where is the tape?\r\n\r\n\tIT'S OLEG\r\n\r\n\tIn disguise - sunglasses and a hat.  Holding his videocamera.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOLEG\r\n\t\tIt's all in here.  All in here.\r\n\r\n\tMEANWHILE JORDY\r\n\r\n\thas been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice\r\n\tcuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tWait a minute, Bruce!  We've got some\r\n\t\tinteresting evidence, something you\r\n\t\tshould look at!\r\n\r\n\tReporters turn as Hawkins speaks.  His crew is taping as he\r\n\tcontinues introducing his broadcast:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tI have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL\r\n\t\tUNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul,\r\n\t\tproving Emil Slovak was not insane! \r\n\t\tHard to believe...watch!\r\n\r\n\tReporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his\r\n\tvideocamera up in the air.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOLEG (ON VIDEO)\r\n\t\tHe knew exactly what he was doing - all\r\n\t\tof this was planned!  It's all here in\r\n\t\tmy movie.  Emil is not insane.  Look. \r\n\t\tLook!\r\n\r\n\tOleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts\r\n\tof the moment where Emil explains to Eddie:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (ON VIDEO)\r\n\t\t...so we kill someone famous and if we\r\n\t\tare caught, we are sent to mental\r\n\t\thospital...\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCUTLER\r\n\t\t\t(points to Oleg)\r\n\t\tOfficers, there's your killer, do your\r\n\t\tduty, arrest him!\r\n\r\n\tThe police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of\r\n\treporters separate them.  We hear the staccato calls from the\r\n\tpress corps.  Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage.  Jordy\r\n\tnotices and starts moving towards her.  Before the POLICE\r\n\tCAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which\r\n\tkilled Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil.  He\r\n\tyells at Oleg!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\r\n\t\tTraitor!!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOLEG\r\n\t\tNo.  You are the traitor.  You are\r\n\t\tmurderer.  I am director.  Action!\r\n\r\n\tOleg pulls his gun.  Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as:\r\n\r\n\tBANG!\r\n\r\n\tOleg FIRES!  Cutler is SHOT and goes down.  Hawkins swings\r\n\this camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. \r\n\tOleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER\r\n\tescorting Emil.  Emil grabs the down officer's gun.  He\r\n\tswivels - rapid fires at Oleg.  Oleg topples.  People are\r\n\tscreaming.  It's CHAOS.\r\n\r\n\tEmil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him. \r\n\tHe puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at\r\n\ther head.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\r\n\t\tDrop the gun!  DON'T SHOOT!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\r\n\t\tI'll kill her!  Back off!  Everyone back\r\n\t\taway from me!\r\n\r\n\tWe hear Jordy's voice above Emil.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tLet her go.  Let her fucking go!!\r\n\r\n\tThe captain is screaming at all his men.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\r\n\t\tNo one shoot!  Lower your weapons!  Do\r\n\t\tnot fire!  No officer will fire his\r\n\t\tweapon unless I say so!\r\n\t\t\t(to Emil)\r\n\t\tLet the woman go!\r\n\r\n\tCops reluctantly lower their weapons.  But Jordy is still\r\n\taiming his gun at Emil.  He is the only one who hasn't\r\n\tlowered his gun.  The captain is yelling at him.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tHolster your weapons!  Back away.  That\r\n\t\tis an order!  No officers will fire!\r\n\r\n\tEmil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at\r\n\tEmil.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\r\n\t\tTell him to put his gun down!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tLet her go!  Let her go!!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\r\n\t\tIf he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking\r\n\t\tkill her.\r\n\r\n\tJordy doesn't lower his gun.  Emil tries to back away.  The\r\n\treporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping\r\n\ttheir lenses pointed at the scene.  This is great film! \r\n\tJordy follows after Emil - his gun raised.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tLet her go.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\r\n\t\tShoot!  Shoot him!!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\r\n\t\tShut up!\r\n\r\n\tMeanwhile, the captain is still yelling:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\r\n\t\tNo on shoot!  No one shoot!!  No officer\r\n\t\twill follow.  No officer will shoot!\r\n\r\n\tNicolette is still encouraging Jordy.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\r\n\t\tShoot!  Shoot!  Shoot him!!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\r\n\t\tShut up!\r\n\r\n\tEveryone is screaming at once.  It's mass chaos.  The captain\r\n\tis trying to keep everyone calm.  Cops following along with\r\n\ttheir weapons lowered.  All except Jordy - his gun still\r\n\tpointed at Emil. \r\n\tHawkins can't believe what footage he's getting.  He's\r\n\tpushing his cameraman to the front of the pack.  Trying to\r\n\tget the best coverage.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tI'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he\r\n\t\tlowers his gun.\r\n\r\n\tHe's pointing at Jordy but he's continuing to back away\r\n\ttowards the police boat.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\r\n\t\tDon't.  Don't let him surrender.  Shoot\r\n\t\thim!\r\n\r\n\tJordy won't take his gun off him.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tLet her go.  Let her go.\r\n\r\n\tThe captain is yelling at Jordy.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\r\n\t\tLower your weapon.  I told you - lower\r\n\t\tyour weapon!\r\n\r\n\tJordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil.  He can't.  His\r\n\theart pounding.  Adrenaline pumping.  He suddenly lowers his\r\n\tweapon.  Turns away.  The captain visibly relaxes.  Emil\r\n\tlaughs.  Jordy suddenly turns back.  Quickly raises his\r\n\tweapon.\r\n\r\n\tJORDY SHOOTS\r\n\r\n\tEmil takes a shot in the leg.  Nicolette ducks under the\r\n\thandcuffs and scurries away.  Emil looks at Jordy - surprised\r\n\the shot him.  Jordy FIRES AGAIN.  Emil is hit in the\r\n\tshoulder.  Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil's\r\n\tchest.  Abdomen.  Head.  Gun fire echoes in the humid air as\r\n\tEmil stumbles back.  Does a funny dance and drops to the\r\n\tground.  Dead.  The captain yells.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tI told you not to shoot!  No officers\r\n\t\tshould shoot.\r\n\r\n\tJordy quietly answers:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tI'm not a cop.  I'm a fire marshal.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\r\n\t\tHe's still alive.\r\n\r\n\tHawkins looks down at Oleg.  He is sprawled on the ground. \r\n\tHis videocamera in hand - he's still making the movie.\r\n\r\n\tOLEG'S VIDEO POV\r\n\r\n\tas it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg.  He\r\n\tlooks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOLEG\r\n\t\tA film...by Oleg Razgul.\r\n\r\n\tAnd Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN.  Hawkins\r\n\tjumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOLEG (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tHow was that?\r\n\r\n\tOleg's head rolls to one side.  Now dead.  Nicolette runs\r\n\tover to Jordy.  Composing herself.  Coming together.  Glad\r\n\tEmil is dead.  Jordy starts to walk away.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\r\n\t\tWait a minute.  Where are you going? \r\n\t\tLearn from Eddie.  Talk to the court of\r\n\t\tpublic opinion.  Take the credit, you\r\n\t\tneed it.\r\n\r\n\tShe turns him around.  Straightens his tie.  Starts to push\r\n\tthe hair out of his face but he stops her hand.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\r\n\t\tNo thanks.\r\n\r\n\tJordy puts something in her hand.  She looks down.  It's\r\n\tEDDIE'S BADGE.  The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom. \r\n\tShe looks up at him.  Her cameraman rolling.  The lens\r\n\tpointed at Jordy.  Jordy looks at Nicolette.  Meets her eyes. \r\n\tHe doesn't want to make a statement.  He still doesn't want\r\n\tthe fame.  He did learn from Eddie.  Eddie was killed because\r\n\the was a celebrity.  Jordy wants no part of it.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\r\n\t\tCut.\r\n\r\n\tHer cameraman lowers his leans.  Jordy smiles.  She nods. \r\n\tJordy turns and walks away.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tGet a shot of him leaving.  Then pan to\r\n\t\tme.\r\n\r\n\tJordy disappears into the sea of people.  The camera PANS\r\n\tback to Nicolette.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n\t\tWell, he wouldn't talk to us, but you\r\n\t\tsaw it.\r\n\r\n\tThe CAMERA PULLS BACK from Nicolette's face and the video is\r\n\tnow on:\r\n\r\n\tTHE JUMBOTRON IN TIMES SQUARE\r\n\r\n\tWe PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER.

The reign of the ter-\r\nrible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent\r\nwhich would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival\r\nhad reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not\r\nyet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or\r\nthe swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a1\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA2\r\nINT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER\r\n\r\nThe man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and\r\nthey were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.\r\nAbout twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking\r\na small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.\r\n\r\nThe tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.\r\nAs the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher\r\ndiscovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know\r\nthe Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond\r\nhis understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-\r\niated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then\r\nhe carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the\r\nhyenas.\r\n\r\nAmong his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly\r\nfive feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over\r\na hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,\r\nand his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is\r\nlow, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he\r\nunmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As\r\nhe looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a2\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA2\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\nsomething in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those\r\ndark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-\r\ntions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another\r\ntwo million years.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a3\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA3\r\nEXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS\r\n\r\nAs the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach\r\nthe shallow stream.\r\n\r\nThe Others are already there. They were there on the other\r\nside every day - that did not make it any less annoying.\r\n\r\nThere are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish\r\nthem from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As\r\nthey see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and\r\nshriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply\r\nIn kind.\r\n\r\nThe confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies\r\nout as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of\r\nthe muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has\r\nstaked its claim to its own territory.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a4\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA4\r\nEXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES\r\n\r\nMoonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit\r\nand leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around\r\nthem, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential\r\nsource of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet\r\nall the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched\r\nsavanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;\r\nthe idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are\r\nslowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a5\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA5\r\nEXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION\r\n\r\nThe tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-\r\nside foraging for roots and occasional berries.\r\n\r\nEight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,\r\nabout fifty feet apart.\r\n\r\nThe ground is flat for miles around.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking\r\nthem about 300 yards away.\r\n\r\nDefenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all\r\ndirections, but the lion brings one to the ground.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a6\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA6\r\nEXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY\r\n\r\nIt had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no\r\nreal remembrance of the past he could not compare one day\r\nwith another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a\r\nhive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the\r\nfinest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he\r\nalso collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices\r\nthem. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever\r\nlikely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually\r\nweak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could\r\nhope for.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a7\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA7\r\nINT & EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS\r\n\r\nOver the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down\r\nfrom the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -\r\nbut cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;\r\nit was merely part of the background of life.\r\n\r\nThis Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,\r\nwas dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher\r\ncrawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides\r\nthe entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.\r\nIf any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back\r\nto the relative safety of the cave.\r\n\r\nOf all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher's\r\nrace was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,\r\nand though he could not remember it, when he was young,\r\nMoonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.\r\nNow he new he would have to find a tree that was high\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nHe stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from\r\none of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a8\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA7\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\noccasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down\r\nthere in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,\r\nand the thought that he might help in some way never crosses\r\nMoonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out\r\nsuch fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.\r\n\r\nAnd in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and\r\nfearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations\r\nyet to come.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a9\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA8\r\nEXT  THE STREAM - INVASION\r\n\r\nThe Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of\r\nthe valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that\r\nMoonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the\r\nnight, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When\r\nthey meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a\r\ndeeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy\r\nbut usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds\r\nbefore the invasion begins.\r\n\r\nIn an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,\r\nshieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led\r\nby a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.\r\n\r\nStartled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first\r\nadvance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations\r\nat the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a\r\nmist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own\r\nterritory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.\r\nHe does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThen he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a10\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA8\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\ndown, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they\r\nmove from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy\r\nthey become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original\r\ndrive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.\r\n\r\nAs he sees this, Moonwatcher's own morale immediately\r\nrevives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make\r\nreassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill\r\nhis dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nBefore he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and\r\nthe two tribes come to a halt many paces away.\r\n\r\nThe disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended\r\nquickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this\r\ninnovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the\r\nfuture. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and\r\nscratch and try to bite each other.\r\n\r\nRolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,\r\nand when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a11\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA8\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\nhe chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp,\r\nand bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is\r\nso satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening\r\nIn Big - Tooth's resistance, that he quickly repeats it.\r\n\r\nEven when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-\r\nwatcher keeps up the exhilirating game.\r\n\r\nWith shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the\r\nstream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as\r\nThe water's edge.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a12\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nEXT  CAVE - NEW SOUND\r\n\r\nDozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is\r\nstartled by a sound.\r\n\r\nHe sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his\r\nsenses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.\r\nNever in his life - already twice as long as most members of\r\nhis species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The\r\ngreat cats approached in silence, and the only thing that\r\nbetrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional\r\ncracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise\r\nthat grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous\r\nbeast was moving through the night, making no attempt at\r\nconcealment, and ignoring all obstacles.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not\r\npossibly have identified, for it had never been heard before\r\nin the history of this planet.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a13\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA10\r\nEXT CAVE - NEW ROCK\r\n\r\nMoonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he\r\nleads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.\r\nHe had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing\r\nhad happened after that initial noise, so he does not even\r\nassociate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There\r\nis nothing in the least alarming about it.\r\n\r\nIt is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of\r\nsome completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy\r\nto see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.\r\nThere are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can\r\ncompare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious\r\nof most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.\r\nAs nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,\r\nhard surface.\r\n\r\nAfter several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a\r\nbrilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it\r\nmust have grown during the night. There are many plants\r\nthat do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that\r\nseem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that\r\nthey are small and round, whereas this is large and square;\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a14\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA10\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\nbut greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be\r\nprepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.\r\n\r\nThis really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher\r\nto a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,\r\nround pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few\r\nthat made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?\r\n\r\nA few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.\r\nThere is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he\r\ncontinues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a15\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA11\r\nEXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON\r\n\r\nThey are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the\r\nsound begins.\r\n\r\nIt is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they\r\nstand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,\r\nmaddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube\r\nand hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first\r\ntime - and the last, for two million year - the sound of\r\ndrumming is heard in Africa.\r\n\r\nThe throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the\r\nhominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards\r\nthe source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little\r\ndancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that\r\ntheir descendants will not create for ages yet.\r\n\r\nTotally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting\r\nthe hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,\r\nand the hunger in their bellies.\r\n\r\nNow, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes\r\nfuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a16\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA11\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\nrotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-\r\neyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.\r\n\r\nThen by some magic - though it was no more magical than all\r\nthat had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It\r\nis as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and\r\nshifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four\r\nhominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher's\r\nown tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog\r\nlies near them.\r\n\r\nThis little family of male and female and two children is gorged\r\nand replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a\r\ncondition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From\r\ntime to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the\r\nentrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.\r\nThe spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally\r\ndifferent scene.\r\n\r\nThe family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;\r\nit is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a17\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA11\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\nA small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids\r\nwithout giving them more than a glance, for they had never been\r\nthe slightest danger to its species.\r\n\r\nBut that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male\r\nsuddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -\r\nand hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon\r\nits skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had\r\nproduced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.\r\nAnd the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one\r\namazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.\r\n\r\nThen the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds\r\nitself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement\r\ncan be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the\r\npig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene\r\nfreezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless\r\nabove the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a\r\nglimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a18\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA11\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\nawakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle\r\nback to their caves.\r\n\r\nThey have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that\r\nnight, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears\r\nattuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher\r\nfeels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge\r\nto kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a19\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA12\r\nEXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia\r\n\r\nBabies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-\r\nyear-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others\r\nthreatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.\r\nIn the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions\r\nhad changed almost beyond recognition.\r\n\r\nThey had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no\r\nlonger haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons\r\nwell; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that\r\nthe Cube had revealed to them.\r\n\r\nThey were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they\r\nhad time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.\r\nTheir new way of life was casually accepted, and they did\r\nnot associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing\r\noutside their cave.\r\n\r\nBut no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The\r\nfirst was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids\r\nseemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better\r\nnourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a20\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA12\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\nsomehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to\r\ndie of starvation.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a21\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA13\r\nEXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION\r\n\r\nWith the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the\r\nground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-\r\nwatcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two\r\nconsecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,\r\nbetraying his presences by a small pebble slide.\r\n\r\nWhen they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,\r\nthey strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound\r\nof the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave\r\nagainst the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their\r\nstrength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.\r\n\r\nThe lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these\r\ncreatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost\r\nhim his life; he goes back to his meal.\r\n\r\nThe rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with\r\namazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about\r\nfifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.\r\n\r\nJust at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps\r\naway from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a22\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA13\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\nonrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-\r\nconfidence and bad luck.\r\n\r\nThe next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They\r\nalso find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to\r\nsee what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small\r\nrock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to\r\npay for such a great victory.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAnd then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even\r\nMoonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly\r\nunaware of all that it had done.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a23\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA14\r\nEXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\nFrom their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of\r\ntheir own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen\r\nmales of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-\r\nlooking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.\r\n\r\nThe Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today\r\nsomething is different, though the Others do not immediatly\r\nrecognize this fact.\r\n\r\nInstead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,\r\nMoonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and\r\nbegin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness\r\nnever befor seen.\r\n\r\nAs the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the\r\nmorning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness\r\nof this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to\r\nan uneasy silence.\r\n\r\nAt the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They\r\ncarry their bone clubs and bone knives.\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a24\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA14\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\nLed by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-\r\nchant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts\r\nthe sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nMoonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who\r\nwalked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his\r\nhand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is\r\nthe bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,\r\ndisplaying its frightful fangs.\r\n\r\nThe Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.\r\n\r\nMoonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high.\r\nThen with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled\r\nstandard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed\r\nby his band.\r\n\r\nThe Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even\r\nthe ability to flee.\r\n\r\nMoonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands\r\n\r\n10/13/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a25\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA14\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\nunsurely in front of his band.\r\n\r\nThough he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge,\r\nOne-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first\r\ndisplayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked\r\nwith a weapon.

Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and\n\ttaste. The paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall\n\tinstead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a\n\tgraduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods\n\tto the Guard at the end of the cell block. He throws a switch\n\tand the door opens.\n\n\tHAMMOND'S CELL\n\n\tCates steps inside.

Hammond reacts to...\n\n\tREDNECK CITY\n\n\tLonghorns mounted over the bar, Rebel Flags, Lone Star Beer,\n\tarmadillo posters. Even the waitresses wear Stetsons.\n\tRockabilly pounding from the jukebox. A Cowgirl Stripper is\n\tdoing the grind on a small podium.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tThis place don't seem real popular\n\t\t\twith the brothers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tMy kind of place. I always liked\n\t\t\tcountry boys.\n\n\tCates smiles, finds a table in the corner. A Cowgirl comes\n\tover to take his order.\n\n\tHAMMOND\n\n\tTakes a deep breath, moves toward the bar. Smiles at the good\n\tol' boys. They don't smile back. He sits down at the bar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARTENDER\n\t\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tVodka.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARTENDER\n\t\t\tMaybe you better have a Black\n\t\t\tRussian.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tNo, man, I think I'll have a vodka.\n\n\tHamnond looks around the room.\n\n\tTHE BARTENDER\n\n\tplaces a glass in front of him, picks up the dollar as\n\tHarmond flashes Cates' shield.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tYou know a big Indian named Billy\n\t\t\tBear?  He used to work here.\n\n\tThe Bartender shakes his head, gives him a scowl.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARTENDER\n\t\t\tNever heard of him.\n\n\tHammond lifts the shot glass and throws it through the mirror\n\tbehind the bar. Sudden silence throughout the room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tNow how's your memory doin'?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARTENDER\n\t\t\tFuck off.

He stops at a booth occupied by\n\n\tFOUR COWBOY PUNKS,\n\n\tone a very big man.  Hammond grabs him by the arm and pulls\n\thim up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tUp against the wall, cowboy.\n\n\tThe Punk breaks free, aims a massive haymaker at Hammond.\n\tGets a right to the stomach for his trouble.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tNow, I said get over there by that\n\t\t\twall ...

On your feet...\n\n\tHe grabs the next by the arm, yanks him up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tOver there...move your ass. Some\n\t\t\tof you rednecks seem a little hard\n\t\t\tof hearing, so I'll repeat it for\n\t\t\teverybody... I need word on the\n\t\t\twhereabouts of an Indian that goes\n\t\t\tby the name of Billy Bear. It's a\n\t\t\tpolice matter and you all look\n\t\t\tlike you'd just love to\n\t\t\tcooperate...\n\n\tCATES Quietly sips his beer. The other occupants of the bar\n\twatch Hammond herd the four Punks to the end wall.\n\n\tA BIG COWBOY\n\n\twhen Hammond isn't looking, he dashes toward the exit, Cates\n\tputs out a leg. Sends the Cowboy crashing into a crowdedtable.\n\n\tHAMMOND\n\n\tTurns around at the noise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tThat wasn't necessary, buddy. I\n\t\t\tgot this under control.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tSome of us citizens are with you\n\t\t\tall the way, Officer.\n\n\tThe Redneck Punks are now spread-eagled against the wall.\n\tHammond searches the first. He drops a wallet on the floor\n\tand moves to the second. A switchblade, some credit cards and\n\tanother wallet fall to the floor. The last Punk has only a\n\troll of bills.  Hammond holds the money up to his face.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tYou're in trouble, big trouble, so\n\t\t\tyou better start talking. Where'd\n\t\t\ta boy like you make a score like\n\t\t\tthis?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPUNK\n\t\t\tIt's mine, what the hell...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tYou must a rolled somebody.  They\n\t\t\tdon't let punks like you take jobs\n\t\t\tthat pay this much ... you sure\n\t\t\tyou don't know a dangerous Indian,\n\t\t\tbecause unless you start talkin'\n\t\t\tI may just have to start looking\n\t\t\tdown your pants with a\n\t\t\tflashlight...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPUNK\n\t\t\tWhat kind of cop are you, anyway?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tI am your most terrible nightmare\n\t\t\t... a bad nigger with a badge that\n\t\t\tentitles him to kick your ass...\n\n\tHammond turns to the Bartender...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tOne of them is under-age.  Another\n\t\t\tattacked a police officer. And you\n\t\t\tknow I ain't found what I came\n\t\t\tlookin' here for yet...\n\n\tWalks back to the Bartender.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tThe tall one had a weapon ... you\n\t\t\twant me to keep on makin' a list,\n\t\t\tor you got the picture yet?\n\n\tHe reaches for a towel under a pyramid of bar glasses. Jerks\n\tthe towel, the pyramid capsizes onto the floor. Huge crash as\n\tthe glasses break into a million fragments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tLooks like you're on your way to\n\t\t\tbein' outta business, redneck...\n\t\t\tNow, let's see what can we fuck\n\t\t\twith next?\n\n\tThe Bartender doesn't have the look of a happy man.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARTENDER\n\t\t\tOkay, okay.  The Indian hangs out\n\t\t\twith a girl down the block. Right\n\t\t\twhere Chinatown starts.  She lives\n\t\t\ton top of the hardware store.\n\n\tHammond turns, grins at Cates. As far as he's concerned, he's\n\twon the bet.  Cates nods, slips out the door.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tI don't give a damn about his\n\t\t\tgirl...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARTENDER\n\t\t\tLook, give me a break, you're\n\t\t\tgoing to have to settle for her\n\t\t\tplace.  It's the only thing I know.\n\n\tHe looks desperate.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARTENDER\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tI'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all\n\t\t\tI know.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tTry obeyin' the law once in\n\t\t\tawhile, and I won't have to hassle\n\t\t\tyou...\n\n\tTurns to go, then turns back.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tBut remember this, cowboy, there's\n\t\t\ta new sheriff in town.\n\n\tSmiles, turns and goes.\n\n\tTRANSITION.\n\n\tSTREET - ACROSS FROM TORCHIE'S - NIGHT\n\n\tHammond steps out of the bar.  He crosses to Cates by the car.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tI think you got something for me.\n\n\tPause.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tThe gun you took off that redneck\n\t\t\tin there.\n\n\tHammond smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tYou made that move, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tWhile you're at it, You can give\n\t\t\tme the switchblade, too.\n\n\tHammond reluctantly takes out a .22 automatic, slams it down\n\ton the hood of the car.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tCredit cards?\n\n\tHammond hands them over with the knife.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tYou already got a gun and you owe\n\t\t\tme a piece of ass.

Look up at the darkened apartment windows. They walk\n\tto the end of the block.\n\n\tALLEY\n\n\tStairwells lead to each apartment above the shops. Cates and\n\tHammond move along the buildings... Arrive at the back of the\n\thardware store. Quietly, they start to ascend the stairs.\n\n\tSTAIRWELL\n\n\tThe metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door.\n\tCates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent\n\twindow. Between the drawn curtains, a flickering glimmer from\n\ta TV set. On the tube, various poses from stridently\n\texercising women.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tWhat the shit is that?\n\n\tLooks again. A female form passes by, goes out of the room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tThere.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tMust be billy's girl.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tCome on.\n\n\tDOORWAY\n\n\tCates gestures to the door lock. Hammond fiddles with it for\n\tseveral moments. The door swings open. They step into a\n\tdarkened room.\n\n\tAPARTMENT\n\n\tCates takes the .38 from his pocket. He stops near the open\n\tbedroom doorway. He looks at Hammond and then both men step\n\tquickly into the room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tPolice! Nobody move!\n\n\tHammond reaches for the light switch. Takes a heavy blow.\n\tSlumps against the door. A Woman's voice screams out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tStay where you are!\n\n\tThe light goes on. Cates' gun points at a YOUNG WOMAN (CASEY)\n\tin a flimsy dressing gown. Saturday Night Special held\n\tbetween her palms, police style... A SECOND WOMAN (SALLY)\n\tstands beside Hammond at the light switch. Larger and\n\tslightly older than the first, she wears a man's shirt.

I want to know what's\n\t\t\tgoing on and I'm going to beat the\n\t\t\tliving shit out of you until you\n\t\t\ttell me.\n\n\tHammond goes into a street rap.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tYou beat the shit out of me?\n\t\t\tDon't make me laugh, sucker.  You\n\t\t\tdon't know how I'd dance on your\n\t\t\tface?  I'll hit you so hard, so\n\t\t\tmany times, you'll wish you'd\n\t\t\tnever been hatched.  I'll turn\n\t\t\tyour face into cottage cheese.\n\t\t\tI'll make your girl think you been\n\t\t\ttakin' ugly pills.  She won't even\n\t\t\tknow who you are, sucker.\n\n\tThey stop by the car. Cates takes the gun out, lays it on the\n\thood.  Hammond stares at him. Cates next takes out his\n\twallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the\n\tcar fender... Smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tI guess the first thing I ought,\n\t\t\tto explain to you, nigger, is I\n\t\t\tfight dirty.\n\n\tHits Hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face.\n\tHammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support. Cates\n\thesitates ... and Hammond kicks out, sending the partially\n\topen car door slamming into Cates. Cates sprawls.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tSo do I.\n\n\tHammond aims a kick at Cates' head.  Cates blocks it with\n\tcrossed forearms, grabs, twists.  Hammond tumbles, rolls away\n\tfrom Cates.  Both men struggle to their feet, circle each\n\tother.\n\n\tHammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates,\n\ta bit sooner than he expected.  Cates smiles.\n\n\tHammond dances in and out... Cates' breathing becomes more\n\tlabored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense. Cates\n\tclears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater\n\tbulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a\n\tbrick wall.\n\n\tHammond is faster...\n\n\tCates is much stronger; Both men on their knees. They look at\n\tone another. Silently, they move to their feet. Hammond's\n\tback is to a wall... Cates keeps him there, negates the\n\tlighter man's agility. They slug away, each now arm-weary...\n\tExchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at\n\this side... Breath coming like a bellows...\n\n\tHammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put\n\thim out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tNow, you bastard, you going to\n\t\t\ttell me what's going on...\n\n\tPuffing away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\t... Do I have to kick the shit out\n\t\t\tof you some more.\n\n\tThey stand facing one another. Hammond smiles. A black-and-\n\twhite comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights\n\tflashing, it slides to a stop. TWO UNIFORMED COPS jump out,\n\tguns drawn.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFIRST COP\n\t\t\tAll right, you two.  Don't move.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tNO, no...it's okay...I'm police.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSECOND COP\n\t\t\tYeah, sure.

Cates falls back against\n\tthe patrol car. Still fighting for breath. The First Cop\n\tlifts Cates' wallet off the Cadillac and looks at his badge,\n\tshows it to the other cop.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFIRST COP\n\t\t\tWhat the hell's going on here?\n\n\tCates walks over, pockets his gun.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSECOND COP\n\t\t\tI've got a burglary call.

I was getting ready to\n\t\t\tfinish you off.\n\n\tCates straightens up from the wash basin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tYeah, right.  You want to try\n\t\t\tagain?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tNaw, you'd just call your pals\n\t\t\tback to bail you out one more time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tThey saved your ass, convict.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tOne thing's for sure, Jack.\n\t\t\tThat's how you'll tell the story.\n\n\tCates dries off his face, starts out of the washroom.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tI'll even put it in my report that\n\t\t\tway.\n\n\tThe door closes behind Cates.

Billy is\n\tseated on the edge of it... pants on, shirt off, pulling on\n\this boots. Suddenly, Hammond is pointing a gun at him...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tGive it up, Billy.

With lightning sudden quickness, he\n\treaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back.\n\tBilly smiles, laughs...then with a sudden, awful roar, he\n\tleaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol.  The big\n\tslugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as\n\tRosalie shrieks.\n\n\tINT. BACK BEDROOM\n\n\tGanz, half-dressed, asleep, gun in hand, throws himself off\n\tthe bed, pushes Sally out of the way ... opens the door and\n\tstarts firing furiously down the corridor... He grabs the\n\tbriefcase and runs to the window.\n\n\tINT. CORRIDOR/DOOWAY TO BACK BEDROOM\n\n\tCates has ducked the bullets ... he is inching toward the\n\tdoor...\n\n\tHe pulls it open...Ganz from the window fires another shot\n\twhich almost gets him then vanishes down the fire escape...\n\n\tINT. BACK BEDROOM\n\n\tSally gets to her feett yelling, runs at Cates as he appears\n\tand futilely tries to hit him....He throws her down on the\n\tbed as if she were a doll ... He goes to the window...\n\n\tEXT. FIRE ESCAPE\n\n\tGanz peels down the fire escapes hits the ground. He stops\n\tfor a second... Then Cates appears, Ganz fires a shot then\n\tstarts to run. Cates keeps coming...\n\n\tINT.

FRONT OF CASEY'S BUILDING\n\n\tHammond runs out, turns down the adjoining street.\n\n\tCATES\n\n\tFollowing Ganz, holding him in sight, but unable to get a\n\tshot off...\n\n\tPARALLEL STREET\n\n\tHammond running down a street near the one where Ganz is\n\tbeing chased...\n\n\tMAIN STREET\n\n\tCates fires at Ganz ... Ganz ducks in a doorway...\n\n\tHAMMOND\n\n\ton his street hears the shot... he runs toward it, down a\n\tnarrow alley between two buildings....\n\n\tEXT. DOORWAY AT END OF ALLEY\n\n\tGanz hears footsteps approach from the opposite direction of\n\tCates.  They move very close to where be is crouched... it is\n\tHammond coming toward him... Ganz suddenly rolls a garbage\n\tcan in his path, dropping him like a stone.\n\n\tCATES\n\n\tComes toward where he expects to find Ganz... Ganz has his\n\tarm around Hammond's throat and his gun to his ear...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGANZ\n\t\t\tDrop it... you come up against me,\n\t\t\tyou're gonna lose...\n\n\tHammond drops his gun.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGANZ\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tHey, cop, come on...l got\n\t\t\tsomething for ya... come on...\n\n\tEXT.  MAIN STREET\n\n\tCates comes out of the doorway from which he's fired...and\n\tcomes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it\n\tdown when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy.  The hand\n\tthat's around Hammond's throat also holds the black bag.\n\tCates walks forward, his gun down at his side...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGANZ\n\t\t\tAfter I get outta this, cop...I'm\n\t\t\tgonna live forever...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tI don't think you're gonna make it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGANZ\n\t\t\tWhaddya mean...I got your gun ...\n\t\t\tI got his money...

Ganz holding Hammond and\n\tthe money...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGANZ\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tOkay, cop ... give me your gun and\n\t\t\tI'll let him live.

Hammond twists as Ganz\n\talso fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet\n\tbackward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the\n\tground, looks at Cates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tJesus Christ, I didn't think you'd\n\t\t\treally do it. You are crazy.\n\n\tGanz' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side.\n\tCates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again.\n\n\tGanz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... A look\n\tof childish disbelief passes over his face.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGANZ\n\t\t\tI got hit.  I can't believe it. I\n\t\t\tgot shot.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tYou're done.  End of story.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGANZ\n\t\t\tI ain't gonna beg for my life. It\n\t\t\tain't cool.\n\n\tHe runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is\n\tstopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his\n\tchest. Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of\n\tGanz' now lifeless hand. Then goes over to Hammond...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tYours?\n\n\tCates raises the pistol.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\tMine...\n\n\tPause.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCATES\n\t\t\t\t\t (continuing)\n\t\t\tYou okay?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n\t\t\tYeah.

I\n                 insisted on being here as soon as I\n                 heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I'm listening. \n\n                             LONGDALE \n                 As Mr. Christian's attorney and one\n                 of the executors of his estate, it\n                 concerns me that a meeting of this\n                 sort should take place without my\n                 being asked to attend. \n\n                             WELLES\n                 Of what sort? \n\n                             LONGDALE\n                 You are a private investigator? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 That's right. \n\n                             LONGDALE \n                 Well, whatever reasons Mrs.\n                 Christian has for engaging the\n                 services of a private investigator,\n                 I should certainly be a party to.\n                 But, since she feels differently, I\n                 can only go on the record as having\n                 expressed my adamant disapproval. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone\n                 on the record, and now perhaps you\n                 should just be gone. \n\n     Longdale's irritated, but has no choice.  He walks away. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Have a pleasant evening. \n                       (to Welles) \n                 Will you have tea, Mister Welles? \n\n                             WELLES\n                 Thank you. \n\n     Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a\n     table.  Welles watches Longdale exit. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 He's odd.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 He's a lawyer.\n                       (offers tea)\n                 Please, sit, here...\n\n     Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 I've spoken to friends of mine and\n                 my husband's, in Harrisburg, in\n                 Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about\n                 you.  I must say you have friends in\n                 influential places. \n\n                             WELLES\n                 I've been privileged to provide\n                 services for people I admire.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 You are highly recommended.  Praised\n                 for your discretion... your strict\n                 adherence to confidentiality. \n\n     Welles nods, sipping tea. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 As you know, my husband passed away\n                 recently.  Two weeks ago now.\n\n                             WELLES \n                 My condolences. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 His passing has left me with...\n                 something of a dilemma.  A terrible,\n                 terrible dilemma. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I'll do whatever I can to help. \n\n     Mrs. Christian studies Welles.\n\n     INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT\n\n     Mrs. Christian and Welles enter.  This office has been lived\n     in for a lifetime.  Giant DESK.  AMERICAN FLAG.  Walls\n     covered in old b+w PHOTOGRAPHS and ACHIEVEMENTS. A large,\n     baked enamel sign nailed up, \"<b>CHRISTIAN STEEL.</b>\" \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 His inner sanctum. \n\n     Welles looks up at the OIL PAINTING over the fireplace: MR.\n     CHRISTIAN, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming,\n     industrial landscape behind him. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Not many people have been inside\n                 this room. \n\n     Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various\n     STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies,\n     shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS. \n\n\n                             WELLES \n                 Pittsburgh? \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Mostly.  That's where he started his\n                 empire building.\n                       (looks up at portrait)\n                 He was a good man.  Notorious as an\n                 eccentric, but that was something he\n                 cultivated.  He <u>wanted</u> to be\n                 legendary.\n\n                             WELLES \n                 He succeeded. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 We were married forty-five years.\n                 Hard even for me to imagine.  We had\n                 our troubles.  There were plenty of\n                 places for him to be other than\n                 here, but he was always loyal to me,\n                 and I to him.  I loved him deeply.\n\n     Welles waits. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I wear a gun when I can tell a\n                 client expects me to.  Other than\n                 that, there's never any reason. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Just curious. \n\n     Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a\n     WALL SAFE.  The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 My husband was the only one with the\n                 combination to this safe.  I knew\n                 about it, but as far as I was\n                 concerned it was none of my\n                 business.  Not till now, that is. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 You hired someone to open it.  I'll\n                 bet the lawyer loved that.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 There was nothing he could do.  My\n                 husband left everything to me.\n                       (looks at safe)\n                 I prevented anyone from seeing the\n                 contents.  I felt these were my\n                 husband's private things.  I\n                 didn't... I didn't realize... \n\n                             WELLES \n                 Do you want to tell me what you\n                 found? \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Cash, stock certificates, and this...\n\n     She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a\n     plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 It's a film... of a girl being\n                 murdered. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I'm afraid I don't... \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 This is a movie showing a girl being\n                 murdered.  She's sitting on a bed,\n                 and a man rapes her... and he begins\n                 to cut her with a knife...\n                       (pause)\n                 I only watched what I could.\n\n     Welles picks up the film, looks at it. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 I didn't know what to think.  I\n                 can't tell you how horrible it's\n                 been, to know this belonged to my\n                 husband.  To know that he watched\n                 this... this atrocity.  But, I can't\n                 go to the police...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Mrs. Christian... please, will you\n                 sit down a moment? \n                       (leads her to a chair) \n                 I want you to listen carefully.\n                 What you're talking about is a\n                 \"snuff film.\"  But, from what I\n                 know, snuff films are a kind of...\n                 urban myth.  Like, red light\n                 district folklore.  There's no such\n                 thing, I can assure you. \n\n     Mrs. Christian shakes her head. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 Please, believe me.  This is\n                 probably a stag film.  Simulated\n                 rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might\n                 seem real, but there are ways of\n                 making it look realistic... fake\n                 blood and special effects...\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 No. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 If you were to study it you'd see\n                 the camera cutting away... you'd see\n                 the tricks they can play...\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 I'm telling you it's not that. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I'm sure it is. \n                       (smiles) \n                 It's probably something your husband\n                 was given as a bad joke.  More than\n                 likely he never even watched it. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Will you watch it and see for\n                 yourself? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 Of course.  But, I'm certain it's\n                 nothing to worry about. \n\n\n     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT \n\n     An 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall.  Welles looks back to Mrs.\n     Christian in the doorway.  Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the\n     door.  Darkness.  Welles turns on the projector and sits.\n     The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images...\n\n     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy\n     FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny\n     GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a\n     nondescript room with little furniture.  Looks like a hotel\n     room.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful\n     girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,\n     staring blankly.  The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts\n     long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl\n     still stares oblivious.  The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and\n     DUCT TAPE.  The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...\n\n     Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.\n\n     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a\n     bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.\n\n     The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with\n     eye holes and a mouth.  The mask covers his entire head.\n     He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,\n     pale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems\n     to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and\n     the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole\n     CLATTER.  It's all one long take.  The CAMERA MOVES to favor\n     the girl...\n\n     Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the\n     girl, knocking her back on the bed...\n\n     Welles grimaces.\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated\n     position.  The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes\n     closed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thumbs\n     to open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his\n     fingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man backs\n     away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked\n     Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid\n     out.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...\n\n     Welles rises slowly, still watching.\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves\n     back towards the girl...\n\n     Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.\n     <u>WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM</u>, but Welles\n     does.  In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs\n     involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his\n     fist to his mouth, breathing hard.\n\n     Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall.\n     The PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING.  Welles is sickened, sweating,\n     still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.\n\n     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, ADJOINING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Silence.  Mrs. Christian sits waiting, troubled.\n     The door to the dining room opens and Welles enters from the\n     dark, visibly shaken.  Mrs. Christian watches him, her\n     sorrow now shared.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 You... you need to go to the police. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 I told you I can't, not yet. \n\n                             WELLES\n                 You don't have any other choice. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                       (stands, shakes her head) \n                 No.  For me to live with the ruin of\n                 my husband's name, I need know that\n                 whoever did this will be punished.\n                 If you can find them, I will take\n                 their names to the police.  I'll say\n                 my husband confessed on his death\n                 bed. I'll say I didn't have courage\n                 to come forward at first...\n\n                             WELLES \n                 It won't work like that.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Any evidence you collect can be\n                 given to the police later,\n                 anonymously.  I've thought about it\n                 and there's no other way.  If you\n                 can't find them... if the only thing\n                 that comes from this film is that\n                 this is all my husband will be\n                 remembered for, well I can't let\n                 that happen.  I'm telling you I\n                 won't.  If there's no chance that\n                 poor girl's memory can be served,\n                 then I'll just have to spend my last\n                 days trying to forget her. \n\n     Welles sits, rests his head in his hands. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I deal in divorce cases.

Your\n                 compensation will be appropriate to\n                 the risk.  You'll need cash to buy\n                 information, and I'll provide it.\n                       (pause)\n                 I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.\n                       (pause)\n                 You saw what he did to her.\n\n     Welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the\n     dining room where the projector sits idle.\n\n\n     INT.

Welles\n     takes out the gun, cleaning it.  Amy watches.\n\n                             WELLES \n                 This is the mortgage.

What happened\n                 was they picked up a young girl\n                 hitchhiking off 81, which heads into\n                 Philadelphia, started up a\n                 conversation with this girl, she\n                 looked homeless, seemed about\n                 eighteen maybe.  They convinced her\n                 to let them buy her a meal in the\n                 city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have\n                 much to say, but they got a sense\n                 she's a runaway, so all through\n                 dinner the doctor's working on her,\n                 trying to convince her that at the\n                 very least she should pick up a\n                 telephone.  Not surprisingly, she\n                 ate her food, excused herself...\n                       (snaps fingers)\n                 That's the last they saw her.  The\n                 reason they came to me for help, the\n                 reason I'm coming to you, is we had\n                 a friend of mine in the department\n                 work up a sketch...\n                       (shows the POLICE ARTIST\n                        SKETCH he photocopied)\n                 They want to see if I can I.D. this\n                 girl, somehow pass along a message\n                 to let the parents know the kid's\n                 alive, doing alright.\n\n                             DIRECTOR \n                 Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or\n                 N.C.M.E.C.? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I figured you share information. \n\n                             DIRECTOR \n                 We do. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 For whatever reasons I thought you\n                 might be more receptive.\n\n                             DIRECTOR \n                 Why don't they come to me? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 This doctor and wife, they're nice\n                 people, but they don't want to get\n                 too involved.

Goodbye.\n\n     V.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP.\n\n     ON THE WALL: there's a DARK SPOT on Masked Man's hand, on\n     the arch between his index finger and thumb.  Grainy and\n     hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO.\n\n     INT.  WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE\n\n     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger,\n     projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard.\n\n     He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING...\n     the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR\n     tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand.\n\n     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven,\n     drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of\n     MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one...\n\n     Welles rolls his neck.  He looks to see the archive's\n     director in the doorway.  The director nods, leaving.\n     Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog.\n\n                                              FADE TO BLACK:\n\n     TITLE CARD:      <b>three weeks later</b>\n\n     EXT.

MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled \"<b>North\n     Carolina 1992,</b>\" flipping through picture cards.  The FACES\n     of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed\n     GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL\n     with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress...\n     a blonde haired BOY with curly hair...\n\n     Welles furrows his brow.\n\n     He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair.\n\n     Welles sits straight.  He reaches into his pocket, hands\n     shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed\n     of the girl from the snuff film.  It's her.\n\n     Welles compares the two pictures.  She's prettier in the\n     card catalog photo, but it's her.\n\n     Welles can't believe it, looks around.  Secretaries at other\n     files don't even know he's there.  Welles pulls out his\n     notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card...\n\n     Writing the girl's name: \"<b>Mary Anne Matthews.</b>\"\n\n\n     EXT.

He drums his\n     fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's\n     registration, other papers and \"Jiffy-Lube\" service reports,\n     uses them to pad the file.\n\n     Welles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket.

A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at\n     Mrs. Mathews.  She tries not to notice then noticing.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 People remember me from the news.\n                       (pause)\n                 Can you drive me back now?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Of course. \n\n\n     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Mrs. Mathews enters.  Welles follows. \n\n     This was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS\n     of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink\n     sheets of the carefully made bed.  Perfectly preserved.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 This is her room.\n\n     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.\n     Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a\n     collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 The police made a wreck of it, but\n                 I put it back exactly how it was.\n                 Just how she likes it.\n\n     Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK\n     where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 Those are for her birthday.  One for\n                 every year she's missed.  They'll be\n                 waiting for her when she comes back. \n\n     Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide\n     it.  He backs to the door, looks at his watch...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I... I shouldn't take anymore of\n                 your time.

But, after Mary was gone,\n                 that's when I got religious.\n\n     Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 Doesn't make much sense, does it?\n                 When everything's happy, when life's\n                 fine and you have every reason to\n                 believe there's a God, you don't\n                 bother.  Then, something horrible\n                 happens... that's when you start\n                 praying all the time.

When kids run, they almost\n                 always leave a note.  It's guilt.\n                 They want to say goodbye.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 There wasn't one.

He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out,\n      opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE.\n      He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray.\n      Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY.\n\n      Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: \"<b>Mary Anne Mathews.</b>\"\n\n      Welles turns pages.  The DIARY'S about half-full of\n      feminine, cursive handwriting.  After the last written\n      page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT.  Welles fingers the ragged\n      edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the\n      very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE.

Max comes out\n     from the porn shop, walks to Welles, looking around.\n\n                             MAX\n                 I don't know what you're looking\n                 for, mister, but so we're clear from\n                 the start, I'm straight.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Good for you.\n\n     Welles and Max walk down the block, past HOMELESS MEN with\n     shopping carts overflowing with junk.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 How long you been working there?\n\n                             MAX\n                 Three, four years.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 What's your name, if you don't mind\n                 me asking? \n\n                             MAX\n                 Max.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Well, here's the deal, Max.  This\n                 thing I'm on right now has something\n                 to do with underground pornography.\n                 Stuff that's sold under the counter,\n                 illegally...\n\n                             MAX\n                 There's not much illegal.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Well, whatever there is, whoever's\n                 dealing, however it's done, I want\n                 to know.

P.I. from PA.\n                 What are you doing out here?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Well, there's the thing; you're not\n                 gonna know anything about what I'm\n                 doing, but you can make some money.\n\n                             MAX\n                 How much?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 How much do you make now?\n\n                             MAX\n                 Four hundred a week, off the books.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Okay, let's pretend I live in the\n                 same fantasy world where you make\n                 four hundred a week in that dump.\n                 I'll give you six hundred for a few\n                 days. \n\n                             MAX\n                 Sounds good, pops.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Here's my number if you need it...\n                       (writes on scrap paper)\n                 When can you start?\n\n                             MAX\n                 Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 See you then.  Oh, and, don't call\n                 me \"pops.\"\n\n     Welles walks away. \n\n\n     INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles sleeps, despite the stead SOUND of TRAFFIC racing by\n     his window.  The PHONE RINGS, waking him.  Welles looks at\n     the clock radio, <b>2:23</b>am, reaches to answer the phone...\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 ... Hello... ?\n\n                             MAX (V.O.)\n                       (from phone)\n                 Wake up, pops.  Your education\n                 begins tonight.\n\n     EXT.  DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT\n\n     Against the backdrop of downtown LA's bright skyscrapers,\n     Welles' rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city,\n     smaller, older, darker buildings...\n\n     EXT.  DOWNTOWN STREETS -- NIGHT\n\n     The only people on the street are HOMELESS and SHADY\n     CHARACTERS.  Welles' car makes its way to a big deserted\n     PARKING LOT.  There are a few cars parked in one corner.\n\n     Welles parks near the other cars and gets out.  Max stands\n     against a chain link fence.  Welles goes to meet him.\n\n                             MAX\n                 Come on.\n\n     Max leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways.\n\n     EXT.  DOWNTOWN ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     Max and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between\n     decaying brink buildings.  They cone to a STAIRWELL leading\n     down to pitch dark...\n\n     INT.  OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT\n\n     Max enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow,\n     labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs.  Welles follows.\n\n     They come to another STAIRWAY leading down.  At the bottom,\n     a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors. \n\n                             GOON\n                 Are you a law enforcement agent or\n                 in any way affiliated with law\n                 enforcement?\n\n                             MAX\n                 Fuck you, Larry.\n\n     Max heads to the double doors, waits for Welles.\n\n                             GOON\n                       (to Welles)\n                 Are you a law enforcement... ?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 No.\n\n     INT.  BASEMENT -- NIGHT\n\n     Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind\n     of small, underground porn flea market.  It's incredibly\n     quiet.  About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows.  The\n     MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so \"CUSTOMERS\"\n     looking through the merchandise make those in the previous\n     porn shops look like high society.\n\n     These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot\n     bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members\n     Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in\n     their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.\n\n                             ONE DEALER\n                 We're shutting down in fifteen\n                 minutes.  Fifteen minutes.\n\n     Welles makes his way to the tables, wary.  One table is\n     covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of\n     PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked.  Each photo is\n     wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape.\n\n     Welles swallows back disgust.\n\n     The next table is piled high with used pornographic\n     MAGAZINES.  There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out.\n     X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands.\n\n     Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette.\n\n     Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks\n     other than hand written labels with numbers written out,\n     \"<b>two,</b>\" \"<b>sixteen,</b>\" \"<b>five.</b>\"  And many bootleg VIDEOS with\n     grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE.\n\n     Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN\n     beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures.\n     Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry\n     looking DEALER who's counting money.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (points to numbered videos)\n                 What are these?\n\n                             ANGRY DEALER\n                 Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films.\n                 Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.\n\n     Welles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Anything harder?\n\n                             ANGRY DEALER\n                 There's nothing harder.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Snuff?\n\n                             ANGRY DEALER\n                 What you see is what I got, mister.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 You know where I can get it?  I have\n                 a lot of money to spend.\n\n                             ANGRY DEALER\n                 There ain't no such thing as snuff.\n                 Why don't you fuck off? \n\n     The dealer sits and keeps counting cash.\n     Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED\n     DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters...\n\n     INSIDE THE CURTAIN\n\n     Folding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent\n     movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag\n     and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an\n     examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.\n\n     In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting,\n     obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent\n     over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG.\n\n     A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.\n\n                             LARGE MAN\n                 You have to pay to come in here. \n\n     Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.\n\n\n     INT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT\n\n     Not many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max\n     eats a huge breakfast.\n\n                             MAX\n                 You've got Penthouse, Playboy,\n                 Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers\n                 them pornography anymore.  Then,\n                 there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple\n                 X.  The difference is penetration.\n                 That's hardcore.  That whole\n                 industry's up in the valley.\n                 Writers, directors, porn stars.\n                 They're celebrities, or they think\n                 they are.  They pump out 150 videos\n                 a week.  A <u>week</u>.  They've even got\n                 a porno Academy Awards.  America\n                 loves pornography.  Anybody tells\n                 you they never use pornography,\n                 they're lying.  Somebody's buying\n                 those videos.  Somebody's out there\n                 spending 900 million dollars a year\n                 on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's\n                 only gonna get worse.  More and more\n                 you'll see perverse hardcore coming\n                 into the mainstream, because that's\n                 evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my\n                 God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his\n                 hips, how offensive!  Nowadays,\n                 Mtv's showing girls dancing around\n                 in thong bikinis with their asses\n                 hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For\n                 the porn-addict, big tits aren't big\n                 enough after a while.  They have to\n                 be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn\n                 chicks are putting in breast\n                 implants bigger than your head,\n                 literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be\n                 Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler,\n                 Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore\n                 films'll be medical films.\n                 People'll be jerking off to women\n                 laying around with open wounds.\n                 There's nowhere else for it to go.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Interesting theory.\n\n                             MAX\n                 What you saw tonight, we're not\n                 talking about a video some dentist\n                 takes home over the weekend.  We're\n                 talking about stuff where people get\n                 hurt.  Specialty product. \n\n                             WELLES\n                 Child pornography.\n\n                             MAX\n                 There's two kinds of specialty\n                 product; legal and illegal.  Foot\n                 fetish, shit films, watersports,\n                 bondage, spanking, fisting, she-\n                 males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond\n                 hardcore, but legal.  This is the\n                 kind of hardcore where one guy's\n                 going to look at it and throw up,\n                 another guy looks at it and falls in\n                 love.  Now, with some of the S+M and\n                 bondage films, they straddle the\n                 line.  How are you supposed to tell\n                 if the person tied up with the ball\n                 gag in their mouth is a consenting\n                 or not?  Step over that line, you're\n                 into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but\n                 there aren't many.  I've never seen\n                 one.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Snuff films.\n\n                             MAX\n                 I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't\n                 yanking you around.  There's no such\n                 thing.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 What other ways are there to get\n                 illegal films?  Who do you see?\n\n                             MAX\n                 First of all, basement sales like\n                 tonight aren't gonna last much\n                 longer.  It's too risky, one, and\n                 two, everything's going on the\n                 internet.  Anyone with a computer\n                 and enough patience can find\n                 anything he wants.  It's heaven for\n                 those degenerate chicken-hawks.\n                 They're swapping pictures back and\n                 forth as fast as their modems can\n                 zap 'em.  But, there's still some\n                 weird shit under the counter where\n                 I work sometimes.  No one knows where\n                 it comes from.  That's local\n                 underground, where information\n                 spreads by word of mouth.  Those are\n                 zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their\n                 hands are permanently pruned.  They\n                 go out in the sun they don't burn,\n                 they blister.  Other than that, all\n                 I know about is the mail.\n                 Classified ads in the paper with\n                 hidden codes.  Secret couriers.\n                 Credit card orders to dummy\n                 corporations.  Interstate wire\n                 transfers.

Eddie responds.  The woman shakes\n     her head, getting up to leave.  Eddie seems to be asking her\n     to stay, following as she moves out of view.

Another's stuffed with\n     paperwork, call sheets, contracts.\n\n     Welles picks up Eddie's phone, unscrews the earpiece.  He\n     takes the small, round LISTENING DEVICE from his pocket,\n     peels off backing to expose adhesive.  He attaches the\n     listening device inside the phone, puts it back together.\n\n     Welles moves towards the door, sweeps the room with the\n     penlight.  He stops at the file cabinets, takes his lock-\n     picking tools out, begins working on one file's lock.\n\n     He turns the lock, opens a file drawer.  Empty.  He opens\n     another.

He\n     stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  Finally, he runs\n     his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back\n     down.  He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink.\n\n     Welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Come on, Eddie...\n\n     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie sits motionless.\n\n                             WELLES (O.S.)\n                 ... come on...\n\n     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie picks up the phone, DIALS a\n     NUMBER.

They start up the stairs of 1204...\n\n     Welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.\n\n     The women hit the center button.  A BUZZER sounds as they\n     head inside.

The two women get\n     out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS\n     painted black.  Welles stops the elevator door from closing.\n\n     The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors.  Another\n     dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter.

One bag's filled with\n     empty food containers and old newspapers.\n\n     Welles tears open another bag, finds burnt out FLORESCENT\n     LIGHTBULBS, digs out a handful of empty PHOTO PAPER\n     PACKAGES, bottles of DEVELOPING CHEMICALS.  He pulls out a\n     few MAGAZINES; Time, Newsweek, etc...\n\n     The magazines are cut up, falling apart, with pictures\n     chopped out from many pages.

He picks another Dino Velvet\n     TAPE, puts it in, sits.\n\n     ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of\n     Klansmen around a burning cross...

Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in\n     slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound\n     woman, struggling.  A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters.\n     He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth...\n\n     This focuses Welles' attention.\n\n     ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Max... wake up...\n\n     Max awakens, rolling over, groggy.\n\n                             MAX\n                 Wha... ?\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (points at TV)\n                 Who is this, in the mask?

On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket\n     shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms,\n     thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples. \n\n                             MAX\n                 Why?

Max sits up, watching.\n\n     ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her\n     hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...\n\n     CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking.\n     He pulls down the woman's blindfold...\n\n     Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...\n\n     Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV\n     FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...\n\n     ... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face.\n     FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch\n     between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked\n     Man in the snuff film.  A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Who is he?\n\n                             MAX\n                 I told you, he's one of Dino\n                 Velvet's stock players...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Who is he, his <u>name</u>?\n\n                             MAX\n                 Nobody knows his name.  That's his\n                 thing.  He always wears a mask.  You\n                 never see his face.  He calls\n                 himself \"Machine,\" that's what they\n                 call him.  Machine. \n\n     Welles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and\n     down the woman's body.  The woman's eyes are filled with\n     fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching.\n\n                             MAX\n                 They say he's half brain-dead from\n                 all the steroids he's using.\n\n     Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.\n\n                             MAX\n                 He's a brutal motherfucker, man.

At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the\n     MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in\n     thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape.\n\n     Welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the\n     combination, opens it.  He takes out the holster, stands\n     looking down at the gun.  He puts the holster on.\n\n\n     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles' Ford waits with turn signal on.

TWO CARS have collided head-on.  A large CROWD\n     gathers.  One windshield's shattered, blood spattered.  The\n     driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood.\n\n     On a nearby street corner, Welles in on a PAY PHONE.\n     HEAVY METAL can be HEARD filtered through the receiver.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 So, what do you say?\n\n     INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS\n\n     Dino's stands in the middle of his office, naked, his back\n     to us, 8MM camera in hand, on the phone.  A NAKED WOMAN\n     dances for Dino.

Max drinks beer.\n     They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit\n     climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in.\n\n                             MAX\n                 What's next?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I'm trying to figure that out\n                 myself.  I have to see Machine\n                 without his mask.\n\n                             MAX\n                 Still don't want to tell me what\n                 you're doing?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Nope.\n\n     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.\n     Welles takes out a thick ENVELOPE, hands it to Max.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 This is for you.\n\n     Max doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about\n     fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope.\n\n                             MAX\n                 What's this?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 It's money.

The woman I got\n                 it from is never going to give it a\n                 second thought.  Let's not make a\n                 big deal out of this, okay? \n                       (pause)\n                 Go be a race car driver.  Go run for\n                 President.

Max watches him go,\n     doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope.\n\n     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.\n\n\n     EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY\n\n     A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied\n     buildings.  A few burnt out cars on the street.  Welles\n     drives through, watchful.\n\n     Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn.\n     He parks the car.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY\n\n     Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.\n\n     EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all\n     directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...\n\n     INT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to\n     the darkness.  A vast, empty space looms before him.\n\n     In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a\n     powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 There you are.  Come join us.\n\n     There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino.  MACHINE is\n     seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M\n     harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.\n\n     Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.\n\n     Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the\n     warehouse.  He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS\n     propped up.  He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...\n\n     Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE.  As Welles gets\n     closer, he notices several things ... \n\n     ... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along\n     with several movie LIGHTS\n\n     ... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside\n     a pair of HANDCUFFS...\n\n     ... Machine is watching him as he approaches...\n\n     Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his\n     distance.  Dino's still firing arrows at the target.\n     Machine's still staring at Welles.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (to Machine)\n                 Hello.\n\n     Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 You brought the money?\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (takes out envelope)\n                 Right here.\n\n     Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then\n     turns to look at Welles with a smile.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Excellent.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Where are the women?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 They should be here any minute.\n\n     Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the\n     table, beside Bowie knifes.  He's sweating.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (of the knifes)\n                 What are these for?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just\n                 props.  Nice, aren't they?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Sure.\n\n     Dino walks across towards the target.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Machine and I were just talking\n                 about knifes.  The beauty of\n                 knifes...\n\n     Dino pulls arrows from the target.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 He was saying how fascinated he is\n                 by their simple ability to be sharp.\n                 The ability of a piece of metal to\n                 be so thin that it is almost\n                 nothing...\n\n     Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the\n     quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 So close to nothingness that it cuts\n                 with minimum effort, because it's so\n                 non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It\n                 blooms open as the blade widens, but\n                 by then it's too late, because the\n                 knife's already doing its pure,\n                 simple damage.\n\n     Dino shoots another arrow to the target.\n     A CLATTER attracts Welles attention.  Far across the\n     warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards.  A CAR with tinted\n     windows drives in...\n\n     The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays\n     behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Ah, ours guests have arrived.\n\n     Machine stands.  He is a giant.\n     Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.\n\n     The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.\n\n     Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at\n     the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Mister Welles... would you be so\n                 kind as to remove any firearms from\n                 your person?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 What are you... ?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Take out your gun!\n\n     Welles brings his hand towards his holster...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Slowly.  Let me see it.\n\n     Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...\n\n     The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way.  Can't tell who he\n     is yet.  Machine heads the direction of the parked car.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Empty the gun onto the table, very\n                 carefully.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Look, I don't know what this...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say,\n                 or I'll put this arrow through your\n                 throat.\n\n     Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.\n\n     The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer.  It's Eddie Poole.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Is that him?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                       (to Welles)\n                 Put the gun down, take the\n                 handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the\n                 bed.\n\n     Welles obeys, walks to the bed.\n     Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the\n     other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                       (still to Welles)\n                 Didn't know what to make of you at\n                 first, and you certainly had Eddie\n                 on pins and needles.  But, lo and\n                 behold, from out of the blue came an\n                 old business acquaintance to explain\n                 everything...\n\n     Welles looks across to the car...\n     The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the\n     wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 This is the fucker?

Be a man.\n\n     Welles tosses the knife, gun trained on Eddie, picks up the\n     Thomas Guide and throws it at Eddie... \n\n                             WELLES\n                 Show me!\n\n     Eddie, hands now free, pushes himself to a seated position,\n     looks at the Thomas Guide.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Show me where you did it, on the\n                 map, exactly where you did it.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Why?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Because we're going there.\n\n\n     EXT.  134 FREEWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles' rental car SPEEDS down the highway, east towards\n     Pasadena, leaving the City of Los Angeles on the horizon.\n\n     EXT.  MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles' car travels a winding HIGHWAY that serpentines up\n     into the scenic, forested SAN BERNADINO MOUNTAINS.\n\n     EXT.  BIG BEAR -- DUSK\n\n     The sun is low.  Big Bear Lake is vast, surrounded by\n     wilderness on all sides.  Welles' car follows a TWO-LANE\n     ROADWAY that runs along the lake's southern shore.\n\n     Welles' car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS.\n\n     EXT.  DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     Heavy forests border close to the road.  Welles' car travels\n     alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown\n     gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken\n     neon and peeled paint: \"<b>Big Bear Motor Lodge.</b>\"\n\n     Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...\n\n     ON THE ROADWAY\n\n     Welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes\n     against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS.\n\n     Welles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns\n     around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...\n\n     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the\n     abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center\n     with attached wings of rooms on both sides.\n\n     The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out\n     skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is\n     boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken.\n\n     IN THE LOT\n\n     Welles turns out headlights and parks.\n     He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD.\n     HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the\n     forest as the CAR PASSES.\n\n     Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.\n     Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.\n\n     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge.\n     Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him.  Welles\n     pushes Eddie forward, gun out.\n\n     Welles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the\n     room.  There dead leaves all over the floor.  The room's\n     empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side.\n\n     Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light.  This is\n     where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the\n     snuff film, without the furniture.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 What are we doing here?\n\n     Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on\n     Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...\n\n     The bathroom's cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and\n     Welles' palely lit face.\n\n                             WELLES \n                 That night... you didn't have to be\n                 in the room, but you were.\n                       (looks to Eddie)\n                 Why?  Why did you watch?\n\n     Eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 I don't know.  I felt like it.  I\n                 never saw anyone get done before.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 You enjoy it? \n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Made me sick, but what did I care?\n                 What did I care if some hump wants\n                 to beat off to that.  It was just\n                 something I was doing for money.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Tell me what happened.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 What do you want to know?  You saw\n                 it, you saw the loop...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Nobody saw you bring her in?\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 There wasn't nobody around.  This\n                 place was a shit-hole.  I backed up\n                 the car to the door and we carried\n                 her in, like groceries.  Dino made\n                 her eat a bunch of pills, we laid\n                 out the plastic, put film in the\n                 camera and Machine went to work.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 What did you do with her body?\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Took it out the bathroom window.\n                 Buried it in the woods.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Show me.\n\n     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned\n     motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and\n     flashlight, into the dense forest...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 What are you thinking you're gonna\n                 do... ?\n\n     Welles shoves Eddie ahead.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Keep moving.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Where do you think you're taking\n                 this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero,\n                 avenge that little girl's death?\n                 Gonna make everything right with the\n                 world?  How you gonna do that... ? \n\n     FURTHER ON\n\n     Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 You can't go to the cops.  All you\n                 can do is cut me loose and walk\n                 away, because you got nothing...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Stop talking.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 You got absolute zero.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Show me where you buried her.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 I don't know...\n                       (nods to forest)\n                 ... out there somewhere.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Where?  Show me where.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 I fucking don't know.  What do you\n                 think... we weren't burying\n                 treasure.  We didn't pace it out so\n                 we could come back and get it.  We\n                 dug a hole and we put her in it.\n                 Your guess is as good as mine.\n\n     Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his\n     flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 You'll never find her.  Nobody ever\n                 will, and even if they did, it\n                 doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the\n                 cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em\n                 all.  Without the film, it never\n                 happened.  Don't you get it?  It's\n                 over.  You can't do anything.\n\n     Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I can kill you.  I can leave you out\n                 here, just like you left her.\n\n     Eddie's not backing down.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Do it.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Don't think I won't.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Do it!  Put me out of my misery so\n                 I don't have to listen to you\n                 whining anymore.  You think it's so\n                 easy?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Easy enough for you.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 I never killed anyone.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 That's right, you just stood there\n                 and watched, because you \"felt like\n                 it.\"  Almost makes you worse.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 What do you want?  You want me to\n                 fall to my knees and start crying\n                 like a baby... ?\n\n     Eddie walks towards Welles.  Welles backs away...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Where you going?  You're the one\n                 with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless\n                 enough?  Come on...\n\n     Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with\n                 that gun, your gun, right,\n                 registered in your name?  Dig the\n                 hole yourself, with your bare hands,\n                 bury the body with your bullets in\n                 it.  Fucking do it!\n\n     Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's\n     forehead, pulls back the hammer... \n\n     Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.\n\n     Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage\n     to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...\n\n\n     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Eddie's thrown face down to the floor.  Welles comes to sit\n     on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun,\n     takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 You pussy.\n\n     Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape,\n     till Eddie's securely bound.\n\n     He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Fucking pussy!\n\n     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his\n     wit's end.  He opens the glove compartment, finds\n     cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.\n\n     He looks back to the motel room.\n\n     He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR\n     PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at\n     it in his hand.\n\n     IN THE LOT\n\n     Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,\n     staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes.\n\n     Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.\n     He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,\n     pages through, studies one page.\n\n     Welles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,\n     dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)\n                       (from phone)\n                 Hello... ?\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 Mrs. Mathews?

She's been dead all\n                 this time...\n\n     MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB.\n     Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there\n                 wasn't anything anyone could do...\n\n     Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the\n     ground, utterly drained.  He puts his forearm over his eyes,\n     gasping, sucking air...\n\n     He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing\n     it to fuel his rage...\n\n     He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the\n     gun and pours the bullets out.  He closes the gun and walks\n     towards the motel room...\n\n     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS\n\n     Welles SHOVES the door aside.  The door's hinge breaks and\n     the door falls...\n\n     Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...\n\n     The door SLAMS to the floor.\n\n     Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his\n     arm with the gun grasped by the butt...\n\n     Eddie's eyes go wide with fear...\n\n     Welles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie's head...\n\n     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS\n\n     The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST.  CRICKETS and\n     distant BIRDS.  We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS\n     through the open door of the room.  A CAR is HEARD, getting\n     LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.\n\n     Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying\n     himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered\n     red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.\n\n     Welles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and\n     goes to his car...\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun\n     into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his\n     shirt, revolted.  He starts the car. \n\n     INT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles enters and crosses through...\n\n     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles goes to the kitchen sink, turns on the water, starts\n     scrubbing his bloody hands, using dishwashing liquid,\n     scrubbing his hands desperately under running water.\n\n     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles comes out of the house, goes to open the rear door of\n     Eddie's car, looking through BOXES of Eddie's belongings...\n\n     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles comes up the stairs with a BOX, dumps the contents\n     onto the living room floor: it's CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, Eddie's\n     collection from the office, HUNDREDS of PHOTOS...\n\n     INT.

EDDIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles walks down the dark hill, heading to his car.  He\n     gets in, starts the car and drives downhill, leaving the\n     headlights off.  BEHIND, the windows of Eddie's ramshackle\n     HOUSE grow bright as FIRE SPREADS and CURTAINS BURN.\n\n\n     INT.  LOS ANGELES AIRPORT -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles stares ahead, in fresh shirt and suit, waiting at a\n     CHECK-IN COUNTER. \n\n     The female AIRLINE AGENT behind the counter types in her\n     COMPUTER, stamps his ticket.\n\n     Welles shifts his gaze, something catches his eye...\n\n     Beside a stapler on the counter, a PAIR of SCISSORS.\n\n                             AGENT\n                 There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed\n                 through to Kennedy.

MANHATTAN MOTEL -- NIGHT\n\n     The Empire State Building in the distance says NYC, and a\n     CAMERA PAN DOWN says another seedy MOTEL...\n\n     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles sits at a small desk, looking through a PHONE BOOK,\n     white pages, finds... \"<b>HOSPITALS.</b>\"\n\n     Welles picks up the PHONE, chooses a number, dials it...\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 Hello, can you connect me with the\n                 duty nurse?\n                      (waits)\n                 Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson\n                 down here in the Thirteenth\n                 Precinct.  I've got a helluva\n                 problem I was hoping you could give\n                 me a hand with.  We had a stabbing\n                 incident a couple of days ago, and\n                 it looks like the supposed victim\n                 gave us a false name and address.\n                 Can you tell me if you had an adult\n                 male with an abdominal wound in you\n                 ER in the last forty-eight hours?\n                       (listens)\n                 You'd remember this guy; a body-\n                 builder, real big guy, five foot\n                 eleven, with acne all over his chest\n                 and back...\n                       (listens)\n                 Alright, thanks for your help. \n\n     Welles hangs up, uses a pen to cross out a number in the\n     phone book, starts dialing the next number.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.

You'd know him\n                 if you saw him... \n\n     Light cuts into the room from between the curtains.  Welles\n     paces, carrying the phone with him, weary.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 He's a body-builder, stands just\n                 under six feet...\n\n     Welles stops in his track, listening, suddenly attentive.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 That's right... covered in acne.\n                 That's him, that's the guy.  Listen,\n                 we, uh... we think he filed a bogus\n                 report on this stabbing, gave us a\n                 false name and address...\n                       (listens)\n                 Yes, I'll hold.\n\n     Welles goes to the desk, takes out his notepad.  He starts\n     feeling his pockets for his pen, can't find it, telephone\n     book, searching, looks under the desk...\n\n     Welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 Yes... yes.\n                       (sits, writing in pad)\n                 Christopher Higgins.  Thirty-\n                 fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street.\n                 Where?  Astoria, Queens.\n\n     Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.\n\n\n     EXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAY\n\n     A relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two\n     story affairs, close together, each very much like its\n     neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.\n\n     Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in\n     school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.\n\n     Welles parallel parks.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles turns off the engine.\n     He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The\n     house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,\n     quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a\n     GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.\n\n     Cars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children\n     pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his\n     seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side\n     mirror, rolling up the window.\n\n     Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,\n     pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG\n     off the passenger seat and opens it.\n\n     He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink\n     wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.\n\n     Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles\n     slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along\n     the gun's inner barrel.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY\n\n     Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house.\n     He looks in his side mirror...\n\n     There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn\n     signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower.\n\n     The car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint\n     house begins to open. \n\n     Welles watches...\n     Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back\n     of his head, but he's huge.  It's a good bet it's Machine.\n     Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.\n\n     The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's\n     garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the\n     garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the\n     sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.\n\n     Welles watches.\n\n     The old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside.\n     The garage door closes behind her.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles still watches the house.  There's a light on in one\n     of the second floor windows, curtains closed.\n\n     Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.\n\n     At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture\n     window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old\n     woman comes to sit at a table.\n\n     Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...\n\n     THROUGH BINOCULARS\n\n     The old woman says something to someone we cannot see.\n     She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of\n     her.  After a moment, someone joins her...\n\n     It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge\n     forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our\n     view, so we never see his face.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.\n\n     Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen\n     putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old\n     woman smiles up at him, says something.\n\n     Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,\n     then goes back to stand beside the old woman.\n\n     Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a\n     kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman\n     starts to eat.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY\n\n     Dawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep,\n     slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.\n\n     Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He\n     calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.\n\n     ACROSS THE STREET\n\n     The quaint house's garage door begins to rise.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles sees this, keeps low, watching...\n     The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman's\n     behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.\n\n     Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.\n\n     ON THE STREET\n\n     Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind\n     him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all\n     directions, making sure no one's around.\n\n     Ahead, the garage door begins to close.\n\n     Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too\n     conspicuous.  The garage door's halfway down...\n\n     Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get\n     there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.\n\n     ABOVE\n\n     In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out\n     from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.\n\n     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY\n\n     Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off.\n     The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves\n     towards the door to the house.\n\n     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY\n\n     Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, <u>seen only from behind</u>, comes\n     to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push\n     clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer,\n     taking out the WRESTLING MASK.\n\n     Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.\n\n     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY\n\n     Welles enters from the garage, gun up.  The dank basement is\n     small.  A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING\n     MACHINE. \n\n     SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two\n     metal poles.  Welles leads with his gun...\n\n     He moves around the sheets, looking behind them.  There's a\n     WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs.  Welles starts up,\n     treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...\n\n     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY\n\n     Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his\n     gun.  No one here.  The decor is feminine, neat and tidy.\n     It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT\n     WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL\n     FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES.  Very Home Shopping Network.\n\n     INT.  DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the\n     kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun.  No sign of\n     Machine.  The whole house is dead quiet.\n\n     He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old\n     woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls,\n     of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into\n     the living room area...\n\n     Yellow shag CARPET.  A pink SOFA is covered in clear\n     plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet.\n     Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.\n\n     Welles creeps up the stairs...\n\n     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR.\n     He opens the door.  It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and\n     SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.\n\n     Welles shuts the door and moves on.  There are TWO DOORS\n     ahead, both closed.  Welles takes the one to the right...\n\n     INT.  MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles pushes the door in, enters warily.  There's a\n     constant SCRATCHING HEARD.  The room is like a child's,\n     except the BED is huge.  Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and\n     COMIC BOOKS.  A DANZIG POSTER on the wall.  There's a RECORD\n     PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it.  A record turns on the\n     turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...\n\n     Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...\n     Pulls it open, steps back, gun up.  Nothing.  Just clothing.\n\n     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...\n\n     DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the\n     stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.\n\n     INT.  GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles stays near the door, looks around.  There's a fuzzy\n     sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby.\n     Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.\n\n     Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...\n\n     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles turns...\n     Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE\n     KNIFE raised to kill...\n\n     Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing...\n\n     Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife.  Machine\n     grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back...\n\n     Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand\n     pinned.  Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...\n\n     BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling.  Machine's grunts, pushing the\n     knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...\n\n     Welles struggles, overpowered.  The tip of the horrible\n     knife is inches away...\n\n     Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance\n     from the blade...\n\n     Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the\n     swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins\n     twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...\n\n     Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...\n\n     Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun\n     towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face...\n\n     The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek...\n\n     Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY,\n     FIRES his gun...\n\n     The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away!\n\n     Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free\n     hand to Welles' throat, choking him.  Welles' face reddens,\n     bleeding from bullet fragments...\n\n     Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat.\n\n     Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed\n     effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute...\n     SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN...\n     The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute. \n\n     Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles'\n     throat.  Welles can't break the grip...\n\n     Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the\n     mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect...\n\n     Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach!\n\n     Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already\n     wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...\n\n     Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping.  He struggles\n     to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...\n\n     Machine rises, charging after...\n\n     ON THE STAIRCASE\n\n     Welles is TACKLED from behind...\n     Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the\n     wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...\n\n     Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the\n     living room.  Machine rises to give chase...\n\n     Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it...\n     Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming.  Welles grips\n     another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...\n\n     Machine grips the chair by the legs.  Welles SHOVES forward,\n     pushes Machine back, letting go...\n\n     Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands\n     and knees, scrambling...\n\n     Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps...\n     Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING\n     down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...\n\n     Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises,\n     extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...\n\n     Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...\n\n     Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up...\n     Machine gets to his feet...\n\n     IN THE KITCHEN\n\n     Welles SHOVES through the swinging door...\n     Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...\n\n     Welles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins\n     to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...\n\n     Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...\n\n     Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...\n\n     Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen\n     sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.\n\n     Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the\n     counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor...\n     Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...\n\n     Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground,\n     tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up...\n     Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...\n\n     Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets\n     him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles\n     airway with his forearm...\n\n     Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one\n     hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand...\n     frantically feeling for anything he can use...\n\n     Welles' face is blood red...\n\n     Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...\n\n     Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh!\n\n     Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching\n     around to the fork...\n\n     Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...\n\n     Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling\n     fingers.  Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR.\n\n     Welles gets to his feet, looking...\n     He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both\n     hands and moving towards Machine...\n\n     Machine's getting up...\n     Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of\n     the frying pan...\n\n     Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven!\n\n     Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door...\n\n     IN THE BASEMENT\n\n     Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the\n     bottom, barely has any strength left.  He looks all\n     directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling...\n\n     Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of\n     dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching\n     desperately, throwing clothing aside...\n\n     Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess...\n\n     Welles searches the laundry pile... \n\n     Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for\n     Welles.  Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE...\n     HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking\n     Machine a few steps backwards...\n\n     Welles FIRES...\n\n     Machine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging\n     laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets...\n\n     Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets.\n\n     Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an\n     empty chamber.  Out of bullets.\n\n     Machine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get\n     back up to his feet.  Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun,\n     walking to Machine...\n\n     Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line\n     in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat...\n\n     Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight...\n\n     Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord.  Welles\n     stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back,\n     pulling the clothes line with all his might...\n\n     The cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood.\n\n     Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling,\n     struggling... till he finally stops moving.\n\n     Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard,\n     trembling.  He looks around the basement.\n\n     Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his\n     holster.  He stands looking at Machine.\n\n     Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling\n     mask, pulling it off.  He rolls Machine over...\n\n     Welles stares down at Machine.  <u>We never see Machine's face</u>.\n\n     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY\n\n     Welles comes up from the basement, slow, hurting.  He looks\n     around at the damage done, looks down to see he's still\n     holding Machine's mask.  He drops it.\n\n     EXT.  QUAINT HOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles crosses the street, going to his car.  He gets into\n     his car, starts it, pulls out and drives away.\n\n\n     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- DAY\n\n     BIRDS SING.  KIDS are kicking around a soccer ball down the\n     street.  Welles' Ford arrives, pulls into the driveway.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles comes in the front door, still a horrible mess.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Hello?!  Amy?\n\n     He waits.  The house is quiet.  No one home.\n\n\n     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- LATER DAY\n\n     Dusk.  A CAR comes down the street, slows...\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Amy sits forward, seeing Welles' car in the driveway.\n     Cindy's in a child safety seat in back.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Amy comes in the front door, carrying Amy.\n\n                             AMY\n                 Tom?!\n\n     No answer.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY\n\n     Any pushes the bedroom door open and looks in.  Welles is\n     asleep on the bed, still in his clothing and shoes.  Amy\n     watches him sleep, sad.\n\n     Amy backs out of the room, pulls the door shut.\n\n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Dark.  Welles sleeps, still in bloody clothing.  He's\n     restless, shifting, MUTTERING under his breath.  Bad dreams.\n\n     Welles suddenly sits bolt upright in the bed, looking around\n     the dark room, breathing hard.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n     Cindy's in her high-chair by the table.  Amy's at the\n     KITCHEN SINK, washing vegetables, peeling potatoes.\n\n     Welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her.  Amy turns\n     to look at him.  It breaks her heart to see him so wounded,\n     but she forces herself to continue working in the sink.\n\n                             AMY\n                 How much forgiveness do you think I\n                 have in me?\n\n     Welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside Cindy, puts his\n     hand out and clasp's Cindy's tiny hand.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I can't talk about it yet... not\n                 yet.\n\n     Amy keeps peeling potatoes, refuses to look at him.  Welles\n     looks down at Cindy, pats Cindy's head, looks back at Amy.\n     He stands looking at Amy for a long moment.\n\n\n     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY\n\n     Welles wears his fishing cap, pushing his lawn mower, mowing\n     his yard.  He has done some healing, though his face is\n     still swollen and terribly bruised.\n\n     INT.  KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles feeds Cindy with one hand, eating his own dinner with\n     the other.  Amy's across the table, eating, watching them.\n\n     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY\n\n     Welles works on the WATER HEATER, wrench in hand, reading an\n     instruction sheet.  He puts the sheet aside, uses the wrench\n     to begin loosening one of the pipe fittings.\n\n     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles drags two GARBAGE CANS from the garage to the street,\n     leaving them by the mailbox, walking back to the house.\n\n     INT.  BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles and Amy are in bed.  Amy's asleep, on her side,\n     facing away from Welles.  Welles lays awake, on his back,\n     staring up at the ceiling.\n\n     INT.  SUPERMARKET AISLE -- DAY\n\n     Welles pushes a cart down one aisle.  He looks at his LIST,\n     takes a BOX of CEREAL off one shelf, puts it in the cart.\n\n     INT.  SUPERMARKET CHECK-OUT -- DAY\n\n     Welles waits in line with his cart.  It's a long line.\n     He takes out his wallet, opens it.\n\n     In the fold of the wallet, there's a PHOTO folded into\n     quarters.  Welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully.\n     It's the PHOTO of Mary Anne Mathews, the image Welles\n     printed from early in the snuff film.  Sad girl. \n\n     Welles folds in back up, puts it in another pocket.  He\n     looks forward in the line to see if it's moving.\n\n     EXT.  SUPERMARKET -- DAY\n\n     Welles transfers BAGS of GROCERIES from the shopping cart\n     into the back seat of his Ford.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY\n\n     Welles drives on the HIGHWAY, groceries in back.  He watches\n     the roadway ahead.  There's little traffic.\n\n     Welles glances down, turns on the RADIO.  Some CLASSICAL\n     MUSIC PLAYS.  Welles stares forward through the windshield.\n\n     After a moment, Welles turns the RADIO OFF.  He drives.  The\n     ONLY SOUND is the DRONE of the ENGINE and TIRES.\n\n     Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with\n     tears.  He tries to fight it, but can't help himself.  His\n     face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting\n     out a loud WAIL of misery...\n\n     EXT.  HIGHWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS\n\n     Welles' car moves to the shoulder, brakes to a sudden HALT.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS\n\n     Welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and\n     over again, wiping at his tears.  He lets out a little high-\n     pitched WHINE from far back in his throat...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Why... why... ?\n\n     He's wracked by SOBBING.\n\n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, CINDY'S ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Amy's in a chair, reading a BOOK, not far from Cindy's crib.\n     Cindy's asleep.  The FRONT DOOR of the house is HEARD\n     OPENING and CLOSING from far off in the house.  Amy looks up\n     momentarily, then returns to reading.\n\n     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming through the house, getting\n     CLOSER.  Amy looks up from her book.  The bedroom door's\n     open a crack.  The door slowly pushes open.  Welles stands\n     there, eyes red from crying.\n\n                             AMY\n                 Tom... ?\n\n     Welles comes into the room, stands before Amy.  He gets to\n     his knees, puts his head in Amy's lap, wraps his arms around\n     her waist.  Amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I have to tell you... I have to tell\n                 you what happened.  I have to tell\n                 you everything, but we can't tell\n                 anyone else.  No one else can ever\n                 know.\n\n     Amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest\n     her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed.\n     Welles holds tighter.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 You're all I've got.  You're all\n                 I've ever had.\n                       (pause)\n                 You're the only one who can save me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                the end\n\n\n\n\n\n   </pre>\n</body>\n\n</html>\n<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<script>\n\t\t\tvar forwardingUrl = \"/page/bouncy.php?&bpae=GbhOd60Gokx7j3Nkf33myxMRPTb9elBfpp4qdqhHXkcnRR7sfb1qyXtvmw5Ct20XGJ16yaUnq2ktOrjrtg7eLFt3Rel4e8dIguVLYQXRctXp40%2FUbDUXZ7ebbvW7PrGGFO2FfMh43DZAmkFWLlwU3FS5lfH6%2FLstsDrJLk%2FEqvPz6bF63PAZLc%2Bjqc%2BhiY8IYnjiBUs0qdQ9f26zYDu5HEqxoVJgS7oqrQIaw%2BZKW2gsGPkuBzmQTreL3yfNB%2BOFDPZAf41eKXtVApdZHdzYO1F86YqvV44tqDxQPuORwiv8bQEoi4oP0MRv954CWOtx7ZA0DQ5t%2B5DUr2hkoAvPlesyxrdLbe366eYazXbtoLxx1ZA6x4qt3cVemhNzSAsbfWgzcqLQxR0rY8ivCw%3D%3D&redirectType=js\";\n\t\t\tvar destinationUrl = \"/page/bouncy.php?&bpae=GbhOd60Gokx7j3Nkf33myxMRPTb9elBfpp4qdqhHXkcnRR7sfb1qyXtvmw5Ct20XGJ16yaUnq2ktOrjrtg7eLFt3Rel4e8dIguVLYQXRctXp40%2FUbDUXZ7ebbvW7PrGGFO2FfMh43DZAmkFWLlwU3FS5lfH6%2FLstsDrJLk%2FEqvPz6bF63PAZLc%2Bjqc%2BhiY8IYnjiBUs0qdQ9f26zYDu5HEqxoVJgS7oqrQIaw%2BZKW2gsGPkuBzmQTreL3yfNB%2BOFDPZAf41eKXtVApdZHdzYO1F86YqvV44tqDxQPuORwiv8bQEoi4oP0MRv954CWOtx7ZA0DQ5t%2B5DUr2hkoAvPlesyxrdLbe366eYazXbtoLxx1ZA6x4qt3cVemhNzSAsbfWgzcqLQxR0rY8ivCw%3D%3D&redirectType=meta\";\n\t\t\tvar addDetection = true;\n\t\t\tif (addDetection) {\n\t\t\t\tvar inIframe = window.self !== window.top;\n\t\t\t\tforwardingUrl += \"&inIframe=\" + inIframe;\n\t\t\t\tvar inPopUp = (window.opener !== undefined && window.opener !== null && window.opener !== window);\n\t\t\t\tforwardingUrl += \"&inPopUp=\" + inPopUp;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\twindow.location.replace(forwardingUrl);\n\t\t</script>\n\t\t<noscript>\n\t\t\t<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"1;url=/page/bouncy.php?&bpae=GbhOd60Gokx7j3Nkf33myxMRPTb9elBfpp4qdqhHXkcnRR7sfb1qyXtvmw5Ct20XGJ16yaUnq2ktOrjrtg7eLFt3Rel4e8dIguVLYQXRctXp40%2FUbDUXZ7ebbvW7PrGGFO2FfMh43DZAmkFWLlwU3FS5lfH6%2FLstsDrJLk%2FEqvPz6bF63PAZLc%2Bjqc%2BhiY8IYnjiBUs0qdQ9f26zYDu5HEqxoVJgS7oqrQIaw%2BZKW2gsGPkuBzmQTreL3yfNB%2BOFDPZAf41eKXtVApdZHdzYO1F86YqvV44tqDxQPuORwiv8bQEoi4oP0MRv954CWOtx7ZA0DQ5t%2B5DUr2hkoAvPlesyxrdLbe366eYazXbtoLxx1ZA6x4qt3cVemhNzSAsbfWgzcqLQxR0rY8ivCw%3D%3D&redirectType=meta\" />\n\t\t</noscript>\n\t</head>\n</html>\n<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<script>\n\t\t\tvar forwardingUrl = \"/page/bouncy.php?&bpae=GbhOdycmolx7j%2B9le%2BE8ouizPnZqtQQzZ%2FA2usTVXWOsvSHMAbfb7Xo%2FekPRTlK6%2Bv9zqAvUbxvkbquIkCdZk2g7%2FSwWs3cbw029cC5DLVSR507cbfOzHS8ReWuwPrGGHG2FdMh41DZAW%2B5A%2FeoOO%2FaAs8NXYBq6A89JXesh%2BiC9KNXmSMRoNwjMi54zPfwFeWnpna2JZz69a972Ycyiv2ielfGPj%2BD3a3XtDKVJDIdyvslzv%2FFR95QPHEWrJVGRN3AtrwyJswRKS8A9Z5QXsAskApkIbkimALOI9LiTSvJA6%2Fw1eyRsWr8Sj7Ynbz1ytfUIjOKdAuXNqvzNI4AM4L4ilJ14FpoqnK7SOR3Y%2BvGuyvuztfEq2eiOkWMIlEmEoGIFjxEPr0xtQ%2BMH&redirectType=js\";\n\t\t\tvar destinationUrl = \"/page/bouncy.php?&bpae=GbhOdycmolx7j%2B9le%2BE8ouizPnZqtQQzZ%2FA2usTVXWOsvSHMAbfb7Xo%2FekPRTlK6%2Bv9zqAvUbxvkbquIkCdZk2g7%2FSwWs3cbw029cC5DLVSR507cbfOzHS8ReWuwPrGGHG2FdMh41DZAW%2B5A%2FeoOO%2FaAs8NXYBq6A89JXesh%2BiC9KNXmSMRoNwjMi54zPfwFeWnpna2JZz69a972Ycyiv2ielfGPj%2BD3a3XtDKVJDIdyvslzv%2FFR95QPHEWrJVGRN3AtrwyJswRKS8A9Z5QXsAskApkIbkimALOI9LiTSvJA6%2Fw1eyRsWr8Sj7Ynbz1ytfUIjOKdAuXNqvzNI4AM4L4ilJ14FpoqnK7SOR3Y%2BvGuyvuztfEq2eiOkWMIlEmEoGIFjxEPr0xtQ%2BMH&redirectType=meta\";\n\t\t\tvar addDetection = true;\n\t\t\tif (addDetection) {\n\t\t\t\tvar inIframe = window.self !== window.top;\n\t\t\t\tforwardingUrl += \"&inIframe=\" + inIframe;\n\t\t\t\tvar inPopUp = (window.opener !== undefined && window.opener !== null && window.opener !== window);\n\t\t\t\tforwardingUrl += \"&inPopUp=\" + inPopUp;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\twindow.location.replace(forwardingUrl);\n\t\t</script>\n\t\t<noscript>\n\t\t\t<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"1;url=/page/bouncy.php?&bpae=GbhOdycmolx7j%2B9le%2BE8ouizPnZqtQQzZ%2FA2usTVXWOsvSHMAbfb7Xo%2FekPRTlK6%2Bv9zqAvUbxvkbquIkCdZk2g7%2FSwWs3cbw029cC5DLVSR507cbfOzHS8ReWuwPrGGHG2FdMh41DZAW%2B5A%2FeoOO%2FaAs8NXYBq6A89JXesh%2BiC9KNXmSMRoNwjMi54zPfwFeWnpna2JZz69a972Ycyiv2ielfGPj%2BD3a3XtDKVJDIdyvslzv%2FFR95QPHEWrJVGRN3AtrwyJswRKS8A9Z5QXsAskApkIbkimALOI9LiTSvJA6%2Fw1eyRsWr8Sj7Ynbz1ytfUIjOKdAuXNqvzNI4AM4L4ilJ14FpoqnK7SOR3Y%2BvGuyvuztfEq2eiOkWMIlEmEoGIFjxEPr0xtQ%2BMH&redirectType=meta\" />\n\t\t</noscript>\n\t</head>\n</html>\n<html>\r\n\r\n<head>\r\n   <title>ATOMIC SUBMARINE revised draft by Orville H.

As it leaps\r\n                  above the surface, the mighty rocket engines ignite with\r\n                  a ROARING BLAST, and the ICBM leaps high into the air,\r\n                  roars up o.s.\r\n\r\n\r\n            339   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - WITH ICBM\r\n\r\n                  It rises higher and higher, faster and faster, into the\r\n                  sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n            340   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER\r\n\r\n                  It, too, is moving faster and faster, on what should\r\n                  appear to be a converging course with the missile.\r\n\r\n\r\n            341   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SKY\r\n\r\n                  This is the 'money' shot - to make or break the picture.\r\n                  In one corner of the frame, the saucer rises swiftly.\r\n                  But as it moves to center frame, in from the opposite\r\n                  corner comes the ICBM, heading straight and true for the\r\n                  saucer.  They meet.\r\n\r\n                  The explosion is tremendous - a mighty, nuclear fireball,\r\n                  great chunks of debris hurled sizzling into space in all\r\n                  directions, a booming, pounding after-shock wave, then a\r\n                  great sweeping mushroom cloud.

Furthermore,</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=10542\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">this was Missy Elliott’s <em>first single</em>, and it also spawned her first music video. Timbaland produced and co-wrote the song and appeared in the video (the beginning of Elliott’s longtime collaboration with director Hype Williams until he was replaced by Dave Meyers). Elliott played up her size in the video by wearing an enormous inflated trash bag – a “screw you” to all the execs who told her she was too fat to make it in the music business.</a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://images.rapgenius.com/ba8f4772afad0332121b801640df1f36.500x375x44.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"

messy soup of a document? Luckily there's a Python library that can help us called BeautifulSoup, which parses HTML documents.\n\nTo understand BeautifulSoup and HTML, we're going to briefly depart from our Missy Elliot lyrics challenge to consider a much simpler website. This toy website was made by the poet, programmer, and professor Allison Parrish explicitly for the purposes of teaching BeautifulSoup.\n\n## HTML\n\nParrish's website is titled \"Kittens and the TV Shows They Love.\" It can be found at the following URL: http://static.decontextualize.com/kittens.html\n\n<img src=\"../images/kittens-web.png\" class=\"center\" >\n\nIf we use our requests library on this Kittens TV website, this is what we get:\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:57:10.244756Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:57:09.456609Z\"}' execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nresponse = requests.get(\"http://static.decontextualize.com/kittens.html\")\nhtml_string = response.text\nprint(html_string)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<title>Kittens!</title>\n\t\t<style type=\"text/css\">\n\t\t\tspan.lastcheckup { font-family: \"Courier\", fixed; font-size: 11px; }\n\t\t</style>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1>Kittens and the TV Shows They Love</h1>\n\t\t<div class=\"kitten\">\n\t\t\t<h2>Fluffy</h2>\n\t\t\t<div><img src=\"http://placekitten.com/120/120\"></div>\n\t\t\t<ul class=\"tvshows\">\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106145/\">Deep Space Nine</a>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088576/\">Mr. Belvedere</a>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\tLast check-up: <span class=\"lastcheckup\">2014-01-17</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"kitten\">\n\t\t\t<h2>Monsieur Whiskeurs</h2>\n\t\t\t<div><img src=\"http://placekitten.com/110/110\"></div>\n\t\t\t<ul class=\"tvshows\">\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/\">The X-Files</a>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098800/\">Fresh Prince</a>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\tLast check-up: <span class=\"lastcheckup\">2013-11-02</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</body>\n</html>\n\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### HTML Tags\n\nThis is an HTML document. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language for writing web page documents. The most important thing you need to know about HTML is that the language uses HTML \"tags\" to represent different elements, such as a main header `<h1>`. \n\n| HTML Tag                | Explanation                              |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| <\\!DOCTYPE>        | Defines document type                 |\n| <html\\>             | Defines HTML document                  |\n| <head\\>             | Main information about document    |\n| <title\\>            | Title for document          |\n| <body\\>             | Document body               |\n| <h1\\> to <h6\\>       |  Headings                    |\n| <p\\>                | Paragraph                       |\n| <br\\>               | Line break               |\n| <\\!\\-\\-comment here-\\-> | Comment                         |\n| <img\\> | Image                         |\n| <a\\> | Hyperlink                       |\n| <ul\\> | Unordered list                     |\n| <ol\\> | Ordered list                     |\n| <li\\> | List item                     |\n| <style\\> | Style information for a document                    |\n| <div\\> | Section in a document                   |\n| <span\\> | Section in a document                   |\n\nHTML tags often, but not always, require a \"closing\" tag. For example, the main header \"Kittens and the TV Shows They Love\" will be surrounded by `<h1>` (opening tag) and `</h1>` (closing tag) on either side: `<h1>Kittens and the TV Shows They Love</h1>`\n\n### HTML Attributes, Classes, and IDs\n\nHTML elements sometimes come with even more information inside a tag. This will often be a keyword (like `class` or `id`) followed by an equals sign `=` and a further descriptor such as `<div class=\"kitten\">`\n\nWe need to know about tags as well as attributes, classes, and IDs because this is how we're going to extract specific HTML data with BeautifulSoup.\n\n## BeautifulSoup\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:57:10.360170Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:57:10.249726Z\"}' execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo make a BeautifulSoup document, we call `BeautifulSoup()` with two parameters: the `html_string` from our HTTP request and [the kind of parser](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#specifying-the-parser-to-use) that we want to use, which will always be `\"html.parser\"` for our purposes.\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:57:10.549704Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:57:10.361695Z\"}' execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nresponse = requests.get(\"http://static.decontextualize.com/kittens.html\")\nhtml_string = response.text\n\ndocument = BeautifulSoup(html_string, \"html.parser\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell ExecuteTime='{\"end_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:57:10.564545Z\",\"start_time\":\"2022-11-07T10:57:10.554562Z\"}' execution_count=21}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndocument\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=21}\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Kittens!</title>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n\t\t\tspan.lastcheckup { font-family: \"Courier\", fixed;

Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=10542\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">this was Missy Elliott’s <em>first single</em>, and it also spawned her first music video. Timbaland produced and co-wrote the song and appeared in the video (the beginning of Elliott’s longtime collaboration with director Hype Williams until he was replaced by Dave Meyers). Elliott played up her size in the video by wearing an enormous inflated trash bag – a “screw you” to all the execs who told her she was too fat to make it in the music business.</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-animated=\"true\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://images.rapgenius.com/ba8f4772afad0332121b801640df1f36.500x375x44.gif\" width=\"500\"/></p>\n<p>The

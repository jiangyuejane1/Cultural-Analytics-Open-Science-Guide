# Cultural Analytics: An Open Science Guide

This is a textbook to learn how to analyze cultural phenomena using computational methods. 

It follows the principles of Open Science to teach you how to conduct research that is ethical, methodologically solid, and accessible. Topics covered include:
- theory development
- data management
- data collection
- data analysis
- data visualization.

We believe that none of these aspects should be disregarded in a cultural analytics project that aims at being truly Open.

The programming language used is Python (code in R will be published later).
There are discursive sections and interactive Jupyter Notebooks to let you learn-by-doing.
